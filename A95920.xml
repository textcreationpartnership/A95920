            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The author in the beginning of this books, teacheth sight generall doctrines, the which hereafter he ſpeciſſed, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth at length.</p>
            <p>The firſt Doctrine is, that he that deſtreth health of body, muſt eſchue and avoyd great charges, thoughts and cares. For thought dryeth up mans body, hurting and leaving the ſpirits, in deſolation and comfortleſſe: which being to leſt, and full of heavineſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this doctrine are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended melanchollineſſs and heavineſſe, the which do greatly hurt the body: for by their operation the body waxeth leane, and cold, the heart ſhrinketh us, the wit and underſtanding waxeth dull, the reaſon is troubled and the memory utterly marred. Yet nevertheleſſe, it is very expedient for ſat, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſle folk, to be ſometime penſive and heavy, that thereby they may moderate the rank heat of their ſpirits, and make their bodies leaner and more flender.</p>
            <p>The ſecond doctrine is to eſchue anger. For anger (in like manner) dryeth up the body, and exceſſively chaſeth and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Secondly, anger hurteth, through heating, and inflaming of mans heart, and it ſetteth alſo the operations of reaſon.

            <p>The firſt is. to live joyfully: for joy and mirih cauſeth man to be young and luſty. By moderate joy and mirth, youth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115892:5"/>is conſerved, naturall vertue comforted, the Wit ſharpened, and ſtirred up, and thereby man is more prompt quicke, and of ability to do all good and honeſt operations, For if is not ſaid without a cauſe, that our joy and mirth ought to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; for when it is without meaſure, it ingendreth death, both bodily, and ghoſtly. This moderate joy is moſt couve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them that have much care and trouble, which joy may be got by the uſe of delicate meats and drinkes by avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch things as ingender and cauſe melancholy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith in his eleventh Book and Chapter) of the failing of mans heart,<note place="margin">Avi diſt. <hi>2</hi> cap deff. cor.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond remedy is Tranquillity of mind, of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and of thought; for Noble men, through their great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe and charges, are much more grieved and troubled then other meaner perſons: Great cark of mind and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, deſtroyeth the naturall reſt of man, which is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for Noble men for they moſt commonly are naturally dry and cholerick, and therefore for them, reſt and quiet is right profitable and convenient.</p>
            <p>The third remedy is moderate dyet, that is, to cate and drinke moderately, as after ſhall be declared, what inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences grow through exceſſe of meates and drinkes.</p>

            <p>Here are declared fix Doctrines which comfort mans brain and the other members of the body.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, when we riſe in the morning early, to waſh our eyes' with clear cold water. The eyes would be waſhed, to clonuſe away the ordure and filthineſſe that hang in the bries of them.

                  </gap>veth ſight, and ſpecially of young folk</hi> The reaſon why the eyes muſt be cleanſed with cold water, is, becauſe every thing muſt be conſerved by that is like it. For <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth; <hi>That hot bodies have need of hot medicines, and cold bodies of cold medicines;</hi> Conſidering then that mans eyes be cold of nature: it ſtandeth with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they ſhould be waſhed with cold water, and not with hot.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Doctrine is, to waſh our hands when we riſe in the morning, for they be inſtruments ordayned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to kéepe and mundifie thoſe Members, by the which the ſuper ſluities of the brain be expulſed and avoyded, as by the noſethrils, the eyes, the eares, and other natural conduien, And therefore, the hands ſpecially ought to bee waſhed with cold water, for the waſhing of the hands with hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, engendreth wormes in the belly: and ſpecially to waſh them in hot water immediately after meat,<note place="margin">Avi diſt. <hi>16</hi> li <hi>3</hi> tra. <hi>5.</hi> cap de lumbri.</note> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, <hi>For the waſhing of the hands in hot water, preſently after meat draweth the inward and naturall heate of man to the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts, and ſo the diſgeſting is unperfect,</hi> the which vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect digeſtion is the principall cauſe that Wormes be engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
            <p>The third doctrine is, to walk a little hither and thither, when we are riſen front reſt that ſo the ſuperfluities of the ſtomache, guts, and liver? as the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115892:6"/>
            <p>The fourth Doctrine is, competently after reſt or ſleep, to extend and ſtretch out our hands, feet, and other limbs, that the lively ſpirits may come to the utter parts of the body, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cauſe the ſpirits of the braine to be more quick and ſubtile.</p>
            <p>The fiſt doctrine is, to Combe our heads in the morning, that the pores of the head may be opened to avoyd ſuch vapors as yet by ſleep are not conſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d: and alſo to quicken the, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the brain. Furthermore to comb the head is very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome eſpecially for aged men.<note place="margin">avi diſt. <hi>3.</hi> li. <hi>4.</hi> cap. de debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li viſus.</note> And <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. <hi>That to comb the head is wholeſome, ſpecially for old men.</hi> Therefore one ſhould daily and oft comb his head. For oft combing draweth vp the vapours to the ſuperiour parts, and ſo divideth them from the eyes.</p>
            <p>The fiſt doctrine is to waſh and purge the Teeth. For the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of the Teeth cauſeth the breath to ſtink. And of the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of the teeth groweth certain vapours, that greatly do annoy and hurt the brain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Furthermore the filthineſſe of the teeth mingled with the meat, cauſeth the meat to corrupt and putrifie in the ſtomack.<note place="margin">avidiſt. <hi>7.</hi> li. <hi>3.</hi> cap. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note>

            <p>In the laſt verſe are certain general rules: the firſt is, that after we have waſhed and bathed our ſelves, we muſt kéep us warm, For then the conduits of the body that is the pores are open: by the which cold will pierce into the body and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender in us divers diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that after we have dined or taken our repaſt, we muſt for a while ſtand vpright, that ſo the meat may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend down to the bottom of the ſtomack, &amp; then to walk a little ſoftly: for haſty moving driveth naturall heat from the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The third is, that one of cold complexion, ſhould not warm himſelf too ſuddainly, but by little and little, for ſuddain

            <p>Here he teacheth, that four inconveniencies are ingendred by ſleeping at afternoone.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the afternoon, ſléep. cauſeth and engendreth Fevers, by reaſon of opilations. For the naturall heat and ſpirit of man by day, draweth to the outward parts of the body, and therefore digeſtion by day is but feeble: But when the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat and ſpirits of man draw to the inward parts of the body, then through their motion, the naturall heat is ſtirred vp, and therefore the night is the very ſeaſon of perfect digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the vndigeſted and raw humours are the cauſe of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which opilations ingender Fevers, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">avi diſt <hi>1.</hi> li. <hi>9.</hi> cap de patri.</note> the afternoon ſleep cauſeth a man to be ſlothful in his operations and buſineſſe, by the reaſon aforeſaid, for groſſe humors and undigeſted, cauſe mans ſpirit flowly to move the body. For as a ſubtile quick ſpirit cauſeth lightneſſe of body, ſo a lumpiſh or a heavy ſpirit cauſeth a ſluggiſh body.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the afternoone ſleepe ingendreth the head-ache.<note place="margin">The cauſe of head-ach.</note> For the groſſe and vndigeſted meate that remaineth in the ſtomack, doth lift vp to the brain groſſe vapors, the which trouble and grieve it And of very conſequence, if vapours of groſſe matter bee ſtirred vp and cauſed, they muſt alſo bee groſſe: For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in the gloſſe of this Aphoriſme, <hi>Qui

               </note> and diſeaſes engendred of the afternoon ſléep.</p>
            <p>The firſt diſeaſe is the Gawt and Palſte, the which grieve vs, by reaſon that the humidityes, that are wont to be dryed vp and conſumed by the heat of the ſun, and by watch, be remain ſtill in the body.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the colour and corruption of the face, through the wateriſh humidities, like unto mans vrine mingled, with the bloud; which wateriſh humidities are wont to be waſted and conſumed by watch, and by reaſon of ſleeping; they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with the bloud toward the brain and the face, and ſo they cauſe the face to ſwell, and to wax pale.</p>
            <p>The third inconvenience is, that afternoon ſleep engendreth the ſpleen and that by the keeping of the groſſe melancholly humours by the day reſt. For as watch with the hear of the day (which doth open) giveth moving and may to melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humours, by the ſtreight conduits of the body: in the day ſleep, letteth and deſtroyeth the paſſages and proper wayes of them, and ſpecially it deſtroyeth, and ſtoppeth the conduties, that come from the Spleene to the mouth of the Stomacke, which are ordained to provoke mans appetite, by which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits all melancholly ſuperfluities are wont commonly to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>larified,</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115892:8"/>
            <p>The fourth hurt is, that the afternoon ſleep molifieth the deyns becauſe that the humidities, the which are went to be diſſolved by the day watch, cannot be reſtored; which ſo remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in mans body do dry up the veins.</p>
            <p>The fifth inconvenience is, that man by reaſon of reſt or ſleep, looſeth his appotite, for lack of reſolution of the humors: which reſolution is the chief and principall cauſe of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Another reaſon is, that the repleniſhing and filling of the ſtomack with fumes and humidities, molifieth and ſhut teth the mouth thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſixt inconvenience, that afternoon ſleep doth ingender are Impoſtumes, by means of humidities encreaſed by the day ſleep, the which draw to one member or other, and ſo cauſe it to ſwell. <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, that beſides all theſe aforeſaid there be two other ſpeciall cauſes, that prove the afternoon ſleep to be hurtfull.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that the day reſt is ſoon corrupted, becauſe the beat of the day, draweth the corporal heat to the exteriour parts of man: but the night reſt doth clean contrary, for it draweth the corporall heat of man toward the inward parts. Of the which two motions there is ingendred a violent motion that diſturbeth nature. And therefore they that wil ſléep and reſt them by day, are councelled to ſleep in dark places and in ſome ſhadow.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe is, that the day reſt maketh a man, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſty, drowſie, and as half afraid, and that by the changing of nature from his old cuſtom that is, from digeſtion of his meat; yet notwithſtanding: that the reſt or afternoon ſleep, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpraiſed, and the night reſt greatly commended and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; yet the ſleep that is taken in the morning three hours before ſun riſing and three hours after the ſun riſing, is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed:<note place="margin">A note well worthy of the obſerving. <hi>Hypoc. in l.</hi> 2. <hi>Prog.</hi>

               <hi>by the which the members of man move and extend themſelves.</hi> This cramp is in divers kinds, One is cauſed by repleniſhing, whereby the member is made ſhort and great, and wrinkling together like leather, or a Harp ſtring, through the matter repleniſhing the members. This manner of cramy cometh ſo dainly There is another kind of the cramp much like a Taboret, which enforceth the member (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his length and largeneſs to crumple together like parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment caſt in fire, This manner of cramp commeth ſlowly,</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115892:9"/>
            <p>The ſecond inconvenience is called the Dropſte, a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall diſeaſe ingendred of a very cold marter, which entreth &amp; inflameth the members or places of a mans body, in which is the regiment, that is, the digeſtion of ments and humors, as in the ſtomack, the Liver, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oyd places about the belly. For dropſie never engendreth, but when the Liver is corrupt by reaſon of bloud.</p>
            <p>There be three ſpices of Dropſie, <hi>Ipoſarca, Aſciides,</hi> and <hi>Timpanites,</hi> and of the Timpany theſe two inconveniences are vnderſtood. A Timpany (as ſaith Maſter <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The third inconvenience is called the Clolick, a peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and a painefull diſeaſe, it is engendrod in a gut named <hi>Colon.</hi> Like as the diſeaſe called <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fourth inconventence and diſeaſe, is the Head ache, called <hi>Vertigo,</hi> the which maketh a man to thinke that the world turneth round: by the ventoſities wich draw to the brain and mixe them with the lively ſpirits and ſo cauſe the ſayd diſeaſe, called <hi>Vertigo,</hi> which as the name declareth is a turning of ſwimming in the head.

            <p>Here this queſtion commeth well to our purpaſe, whether a man ſhould eat more at dinner, or at Supper. For dafini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof is to be noted: that after the quantity of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (more or leſſe) meat is convenient at ſupper or at dinner. For either the bodies be whole and ſound, or elſe ſicke. If they be ſicke, either they incliue to materiall ſickeneſſe or vnu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the ſickneſſe be not cauſed through ſome humour: one may eat the more at ſupper becauſe in ſuch ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, nature only endeavoreth to digeſt the meat. If the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be material, one may eat the more at dinner, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the fourth Treatiſe, in the fift Chapter of the curation of falling ſickneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon hereof is this at ſuch ſeaſon the feeble nature hath help by the naturall heat of the Sunne to digeſt, and the ſuperfluities thereby are more reſolved, wherefore the refecton ſhould be larger at dinner then at ſupper. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, becauſe the heat of the day, which cauſeth digeſtion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115892:10"/>joyneth with the naturall heat of mans body, (are there by day time) two Cundry beates to help the digeſtion: but it is not ſo in the night. Likewiſe nature endeavoureth her ſelf moſt by night, to digeſt the ſuperfluities. And therefore ſhe ſhould not be hindred with the digeſting of too much meat: And though it be ſo, that the naturall heat of man is in many things fortified in the night, as by retraction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and reduction of ſleepe: yet that ſelfe ſame heat can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digeſt two divers things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the meats, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities.</p>
            <p>Then it followeth, that ſuch folke ſhould eaſe leſſe at ſupper then at dinner. At the bodye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ities, avoiding all through their vigour and ſtrength as mighty bigge men: ſuch may eat more at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For the nature of theſe bodies labour only by night to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the meat received: and not to ripe the ſuperfluities, for (in a manner they have none. Alſo they labour only to fortifie their Bodies, which wareth more ſtronger by night then by day: becauſe the blood and corporall ſpirits be engendred by night in a more quantity, and better divided throughout the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>If the bodyes be not greatly diſpoſed to health (as it is rehearſed) but are diſpoſed to be lightly ſicke: then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they travell and labour ſore continually with their arms and hands, or not, it is beſt they eat more at dinner then at ſupper. For meate is not onely taken to nouriſh and reſtors the body, but alſo to make moyſt and to over-ſprinkle and water the members that (through great labour and travell) they war not dry and likewiſe to withſtand the diſſolution of natural heat.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cauſe of good digeſtion.</p>
            <p>And therefore a good and large ſupper, is more expedient for them, then a large dinner. Alſo, the ſame perſons were not brought up (before this ſeaſon) in ſuch great travail and therfore their bodies are ful of bumidities: which little meat at dinner, may reſiſt the revolutions, cauſed by great motions and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. But in caſe they travall little and-eaſily by the way, to eat more at dinner then at ſupper is beſt: as it is declared in ſick bodies, for they moſt commonly are féeble both of complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and of digeſtion, and the heat and light of the ſun doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their naturall heat and ſpirits. Alſo the reaſon hereof is this the corporall conduits, and paſſages by day are open, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſuperfluities of the body, are ſooner expulſed by day then by night,</p>
            <p>Further, they ought to eate but little meate by Night, for then, nature is greatly buſted to digeſt and bring to good point. And though the digeſtion to digeſt, and great repleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of meats and the ſuperfluous humors: be holy by the night, yet nevertheleſſe, the ſtrengthning thereof is not ſufficient to digeſt great repletions of meats, and alſo ſuper fluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, And know withall, that the cuſtom in eating much or tittlet adinner or ſupper, ought to be regarded and kept, <hi>For cuſtom is good and neceſsary, both for the health of the body,</hi>

               <hi>and to cure ſickneſs,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. For ſuddain change of cuſtome is very hurtfull and ſpecially for old folkes.

            <p>And thus it is well proved that we ought to eat more at dinner then at ſupper, and that, becauſe ſickneſſes are moſt commonly materials; yet for all that, if a man could be conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with one repaſt in a day, it were better to take it at a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then at a ſupper.

               <hi>That all manner of repleations hurt the ſtomacke.</hi> For the great eater (by repleation) augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his body, becauſe he digeſteth not his meat: but he that eateth mode cately hath always ſome appetite, and encroaſeth his body. in regard he digeſteth well his meat.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ought to take heed. that we hurt not our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach by over much repleation, nor that we make not our ſelve purfle and the pulſe to beat over vehemently.</p>
            <p>In like manner, Repleation that engendreth loathing of meat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if it come by clean meats it engendreth ſharp Fevers and bot Impoſtumes</p>
            <p>It followeth then that this repleation muſt bee eſchewes above all other things For as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith <hi>overmuch repleation,</hi>

            <p>Here are certaine commandements, the which he that deſtreth his health, muſt of neceſſity obſerve and kéep more duely, then eat or drink.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, he ſhould eat no manner of til meats, without his ſtomack be neat and purged from all ill humours, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or other convenient wayes. For if a man receive meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſtomack, in the which are corrupt humours; they will mingle themſelves together, and cauſe the meat nowly enten, to corrupt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, to eate no more till the firſt meate that is eaten, be digeſted and avoyded out of the ſtomack. For there is nothing more hurtfull to mans body then to receive meat upon meat that is but onely begun to be digeſted. For the meat laſt taken, ſhall let the digeſtion of that that was firſt eaten, and the digeſtion of the meat firſt taken, ſhall be firſt finiſhed, which departeth to the Liver by the veins called <hi>Meſeriakes,</hi> and therewith carryeth the meat laſt taken, not yet well digeſted, whereof raw humors, and vndigeſted, are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in mans body.</p>
            <p>Further, in the Text are put two tokens, to know when the ſtomack in void of the meat before eated. The firſt, is very hunger. And for a knowledge heteof, know aſſuredly, that there are two manner of hungers; very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and fained hunger. Very hunger is deſcribed by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> in this wiſe.<note place="margin">Galen in apho. Hip:</note> 
               <hi>Very hunger</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is when a man nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115892:12"/>meat: but fained hunger is an appetite to have meat, though the body have no need thereof.</hi> And as very hunger commeth by contraction, and corrugation of the veines, proceeding from the mouth of the ſtomacke, by ſuggillation of the members needing meate, ſo in like manner, ſayned hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is wont to bee cauſed of them, that conſtratue, that they ſhould provoke the mouth of the ſtomacke (the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers having no need of food) as by cold things, hard, or ſharp.</p>
            <p>And of this ſign and ſecand precept precedent, <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. <hi>No man ought to eat but after he hath a luſt: Nor he ſhould not tarry long therein when luſt pricketh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Avi. <hi>3.</hi> doc. c. ca. de co qup. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>unleſſe it be a fained luſt; as the luſt of Drunkards, or ſuch whoſe ſtomackes abhorreth meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For to endure hunger long, filleth the ſtomack full of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupt humours. And after in the ſame Chapter he ſayth. <hi>That whoſoever do love their health, ſhould never eat till they have a true luſt, nor till their ſtomack and uppermoſt entrails be voyded of the firſt food that they took,</hi> For the moſt dangerous thing that may chance to a mans body, is to receive meat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vndigeſted meat.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that ſigniſteth true laſt,<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true luſt, or very hunger.</note> or very hunger, is ſtender dyet precedent: that is: ſmall ſuſtenance before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for when hunger followeth thereupon, it is very trus hunger, Furthermore, ye ſhall vnderſtand, that to eats much, and of ſundry meats mingled together at one repaſt or refection, is worſt of all: as of fleſh and fiſh. Chickens, and Pork, and afterward, to prolong the time in eating, For the firſt meat, beginneth but then to digeſt, when the other meates are ſerved into the table: and ſo the parts of the meat be unalike in digeſtion. So that the firſt taken are digeſted. ere the laſt that is eaten, can come to the middeſt of their digeſting, and this cauſeth that ſome parto corrupt other ſome. And of thie thing <hi>Avicen</hi> war neth vs, ſaying: <hi>There is nothing more dangerous, then to mingle divers meats and ſuſtenances together, and afterward to prolong the time in eating: for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115892:12"/>when the laſt meat is received, the firſt is well near digeſted.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Avi. <hi>3 1.</hi> doc. c. ca. de co, &amp;c</note> Thore fore, the ſaid meats in divers of their poets (as touching dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, be not alike.</p>
            <p>But yet know, that prolonging of the time in eating mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately (as an hours ſpace to chaw &amp; ſwallow our meat, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, and helpeth much to the conſervation of health. For good chawing and ſwallowing down is as good as half a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, or elſe doth greatly hinder it, but prolonging of time in eating with talking and telling of tales, of the length of two or three hours; is very hurtfull, and therefore are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the diſeaſes before rehearſed.</p>

            <p>But this ought to be minded which is a comon thing, that all things that are moiſt, ſlippery &amp; lightly goeth vnder, ſhould be eaten firſt, and ſo ſhould Peaches, which ſwiftly go to the bottome of the ſtomack, and make way for the meates that ſhall come after. But when they be eaten laſt, they both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves, and alſo the other meats, And thus it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that this ſaying ought to be underſtood of Peaches,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115892:13"/>eaten after other meates. For when they be eaten before meat, they be good for the ſtomack, and they moliffe the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">avil <hi>2</hi> cap. de perficis.</note> and provoke the appetite as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth: <hi>Ripe Peaches be good for the ſtomack, and cauſeth one to have an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to meat.</hi> And further he ſayth: <hi>They ought not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after other meat, for then they corrupt, but they muſt be eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>

And the ſweeter ſavour that Peares have, and the more ripe, the better they be. And alſo ſodden Peares be better then raw, and they

            <p>And it is to be well noted that the fleſh that is inclined to dryneſſe muſt be ſod, and the fleſh that inclined to humidity. muſt be roaſted, thereby to temper their drineſſe and humidity.

            <p>The reaſon why White wine leaſt burteth the head, is this, becauſe it is leſſe tumiſh, and leſſe vapourous than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That it provoketh or cauſeth one to his urine, more than other, appeareth by this ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates.

            <p>Here are touched, twelve manner of things, the which do greatly nouriſh and make fat mans body.</p>
            <p>The firſt is bread made of wheat, which as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Fatteth ſwiftly, |ſpecially when it is made of new red Wheat. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſayth. <hi>Wheat is neighbour to temperance, although it incline a little to heat, and the heavieſt and ſoundeſt Wheat doth nouriſh beſt;</hi> and of all grains, it is moſt wholeſome for all folks: and the blood that is ingendred thereof, is more temperate then of any other grain.</p>
            <p>As touching the choices of Wheat, ye ſhall vnderſtand, that the election is to be conſidered in two things. Firſt, the ſubſtance of the Wheat ought to be conſidered and ſecondly; the preparation thereof. And of the choice, touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. <hi>That that Wheat is beſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Choiſe of Wheat.</note> 
               <hi>that is neither hard nor ſoft, great, fat, and new, and not too old, and between red and white.</hi> Black wheat is an ill nouriſher. <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith it is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</p>
            <p>Now of the Choice, concerning the preparation, know, that all things made of Wheaten flower, do deſcend from the ſtomacke ſlowly, and they engender groſſe humours. and do cauſe opilations about the liver, augmenting the Splene, and engendring the Stone; for when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, it nouriſheth much. Wheate ſodden, is heavy meat, and hard to digeſt: but when it digeſted, it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth ſtrongly, and ſtraineth a man much. But wheat made in bread, well leavened and baked in an ovell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Is a nouriſher and a fatter,</hi> And although greene Cheeſe doth nouriſh and fat; yet it is not wholeſome in the Regiment of Health, for thereof come the inconveniences before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is <hi>Teſticles</hi> or Stones,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>This alſo may be underſtood of Hogs ſtones very fat that hath not boared Sow; for as Porke, of all four legged beaſts (touching nouriſhment) is beſt: in like manner the ſtones, in regard of other beaſts ſtones, are the beſt, And here is to be well noted, that the ſtones of aged beaſts, whoſe ſeed is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, be nothing nouriſhing but the ſtones of young beaſts that be not able to do their kind, &amp; whoſe ſeed of generation is not yet ripe, be meetely good nouriſhment, if they be well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.</p>
            <p>The fift thing is Porke,<note place="margin">Pork.</note> in chooſing whereof, and of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſame, hath been largely declared before; whereof <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Gal. de moribis curandis li. <hi>6 Eating of braines.</hi>

            <p>The ſeventh thing is Marrow, which being well digeſted nouriſheth much, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth, and it is lightly turned into blood.<note place="margin">avi <hi>2</hi> cau ca de cere avi ibi dim ca. de medula.</note>

            <p>Yet nevertheleſſe, it deſtroyeth the appetite &amp; maketh one to loath his meat: and therefore <hi>Avicen</hi> teacheth us, to eat it with Pepper, Now touching the choiſe of Marrow, <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth, <hi>That the Marrow of Veal, of a Hart of a Bull, of Goates and of ſheep, is moſt wholeſom.</hi> And ſome ſay, the marrow of young white bulls is very wholeſom and good.</p>
            <p>The eight thing is, ſwéet Wines, whereof we ſhall intreat more hereafter.</p>
            <p>The ninth thing is delicious meats:<note place="margin">Marrow. Delicious meats. <hi>Gal, in</hi> 2. <hi>Par: tic. apho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. <hi>That all ſavory meat, wherein one hath a delectation, when he eateth it is of the ſtomack received, reteined, and digeſted, with a more fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire then any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the meat be loathſome, the ſtomack will not abide, it whereof vomit, abborring of meat, inflation, and belching are engendred, &amp; this is the reaſon, that we ſée ſome more healthy, being fed with courſe meat then with good, becauſe ſuch courſe meat is more delicious vnto them.</p>
            <p>The tenth thing is Rere Egges:<note place="margin">Rere-egs.</note> which in ſmall quantity do nouriſh much, and whereof we have ſpoken before at large.</p>
            <p>The eleventh thing is ripe figst which (though their ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) nouriſh and fatten much.</p>
            <p>As touching Figges, though they nouriſh not ſo ſtrongly as fleſh and graine; yet there is no fruit is ſtrong a nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher: as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">avi. <hi>2.</hi> can ca. de ſicubus, avi. in re civs, quod comedi.</note> 
               <hi>That Figges nouriſh more then any other fruits.</hi> And beſide he ſayth, <hi>That fruits of moſt nouriſhment, and moſt like and neare unto fleſh in nouriſhing, be Figges, very ripe, Rayſins, and Dates.</hi> As concerning the choice of them know, that as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayeth:<note place="margin">choice of figs.</note> 
               <hi>The white figges bee beſt</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:115892:22"/>for they be lighter: and next vnto them, be the ruddy or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine Figs, and then the black, for they that be ripe are beſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo the moyſt and new figs are greater and ſwifter, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers, then the dry, and ſooner paſſe from the ſtomack to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and they moyſt the Liver more, and are more mellow then the dry figs. But yet the dry Figs cullats not ſo much, and are more wholeſome for the ſtomack, then the moiſt, for <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. <hi>The dry Figges (in their operations be laudable, but the bloud which of them is engendred is not good becauſe therof lice be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: but eat them with nuts and Almonds, and their humour made good.</hi> And he ſaith alſo. <hi>The operation of Figs is maryellous nouriſhing, if they be taken faſting with nuts or Almonds; for they open and prepare the way for meat.</hi> But yet the Fig that is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a Nut, nouriſheth more then the Fig which is eaten with an Almond. And know withall that all figs do enfiate, mellow and expulſe ſuperfluityes to the skinue: and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke ſweat, and avoyd or remotine away ſharpueſſe of the throat, and they cleanſe the breaſt, lungs, and pipe of the ſame, and open all manner of opilations of the Liver and ſpleue.</p>
            <p>The twelfth thing is Grapes,<note place="margin">Grapes.</note> that is to ſay, ſuch as are ſweet and ripe: for ye ſhall vnderſtand, that there are three manner of Grapes. Some bee greene and ſowre, whereof verjuyce is made; theſe Grapes bind fore, and repreſſe the ruddy colour and Sanguine, and are wholeſome for a cholle. rick lask. There is another ſort naturally green and new, whereof wine is made. Thoſe Grapes (ſpecially if they be white, and the graines and bucks ſet apart or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) do cauſe one to have a Lask, and they nouriſh more then the other fruits,<note place="margin">avi. <hi>2.</hi> can. ca di vna.</note> but not ſo much as figges, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. Yet of truth, they engender ventoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ties, inflations, and ache of the belly. But if they remains two or three dayes after then be gathered, till the husk be ſomewhat aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged they nouriſh the better, and are leſſe laxative, for then they inflate not.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115892:22"/>
            <p>And they whoſe ſtomack is tull of meat, and vncleane with ill humours, ſhould in no wiſe eat Grapes, eſpecially if they be new, and without graines or kitue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: for in ſuch a ſtomach they corrupt ſoone, becauſe they are overſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and cannot avoyd out of the ſtomacks after they be digeſted, by reaſon of the meat, that is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et digeſted. Wherefore when they both be corrupted in the ſtomack, then they corrupt the other meat, as likewiſe it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of other fruits larative. And he that will eat Grapes green and new gathered, it is good to lay them firſt in warm water an hour, and after in cold water, and then eate them.</p>

            <p>Here in this Text are declared, five manner of proofes of good wine.</p>
            <p>The firſt,<note place="margin">The tokens of good wine.</note> is the ſmell for wine of good odour, and ſavour, multiplyeth or encreaſeth a mans ſpirits, and as <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> faith. <hi>It nouriſheth well, and ingendreth good blood:</hi> but ſtincking wine is vnwholeſome for mans nature, and doth engender groſſe and melancholly ſpirits. And after the mind of the ſaid <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſtant. <hi>5.</hi> Theoric. Gal. con <hi>3 1.</hi> part. reg. acu.</note> 
               <hi>It engendreth ill bloud, and head ache, that of the ill ſume aſcendeth to the head. Galen</hi> ſayth: <hi>That wine that hath good ſmell, engendreth good blood:</hi> but it filleth ones bead full of ſumes and vapors by reaſon of the ſubtility and and heat thereof: but wine of ill ſmel, after the quantity of ill bloud ingendred thereby, doth hurt the head very little, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is cold and groſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is favor: for like as good ſavory meat nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth beſt, and is better received of the ſtomack then other as is aforeſaid: ſo in likewiſe doth wine.</p>
            <p>But ye ſhall vnderſtand, that Wines differ in ſavourings, for ſome that be ſweet, are more nouriſhing then other, and they engender groſſe blood, and moiſt the belly, and yet they be hard of digeſtion and make one thirſty. There is another ſort of wines called <hi>Spontica or Stiptica,</hi> which comfort the ſtomack and eaſe the belly: but they hurt the breaſt and purtenance, as the lungs and pipe thereof they he wholeſome for the entrails, and are hard of ot digeſtion. There be other wines, that are ſharp or ſowr, the which provoke one to brine, they do not engender humours, but they diſſolve them. There be other Wines that are bitter:<note place="margin">Conſtant. <hi>5.</hi> theoric.</note> 
               <hi>But they be not ſo hot</hi> as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſayth.</p>
            <p>The third thing is clearneſſe or brightneſſs, which ſhe ſhe booth the pureneſſe of the wine, and ſo conſequently of the ſpirils engendred.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is the colour. An their colour Wines
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115892:23"/>very and differ greatly in their nouriſhing. For the ruddier Wines of the ſame, do nouriſh more then while. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be more wholeſome for lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e fath then white be, and white more wholeſome for them that he ſat. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diverſity of Wine in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> we have ſpoken before of <hi>Ova recentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, in the Text are rehearſed five ſpeciall things by which a man ſhould prove and know good wine. The firſt is the ſtrength, which is known by the operation.<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>3</hi> Reg. a. culo con. Culo. <hi>1</hi>
               </note> For as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, <hi>Strong win is that, that vehemently milameth a man; body, and replea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth or filleth the head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſtrong wine is a ſpeciall increaſer of the ſpirits, and a great nouriſher. But yet I adviſe them that have a weak braine to beware how they drink ſtrong wine except it be wel allayed with water: For the fumiſhneſſe thereof, hurteth the head.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, fairneſſe of the Wine. For the fairneſſe or goodlineſſe of the Wine, cauſeth one to drinke it deſirouſly, which doth cauſe it better to digeſt, and better to nouriſh.</p>
            <p>The third thing is fragrant, and of good odour. For fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and redolentwine comforteth moſt, and engendreth ſubtil ſpirits, as it is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to, Wine ought to be cold, touching the taſte, but hot in effect and operation. For Wine made hot by reaſon of the clearneſſe and ſineneſſe, doth overcome a mans braine the ſooner. and enſeebleth the ſinews, and hurteth the head, except it be taken moderately.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing, is that wine ought to be ſtrisk and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and with the ſpuming to make a little noiſe and the ſpume to be then and ſoon flaſhed and the ſpume to remain in the mids of the cup For if it have not theſe properties, it muſt be called hanging (that is ſuable wine: and ſpecially, if it make no ſound, and hath great bubbles and ſpume, that remain long by the ſides of the Cup.</p>

            <p>Here is one doctrine of wine declared: the which is, that groſſe and ſweet wines do nouriſh more, then any other of the like ſort.<note place="margin">conſtant. <hi>5.</hi> theoric. aug <hi>3 1.</hi> de reg. aquae &amp; vini. avi <hi>2.</hi> tract. <hi>1.</hi> ica. <hi>3.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And although this Text may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es verified by all dulcet Wines, yet the moderate dulce or ſweet wine is choſen, and not that that exceeding dulce, as Muskadell: for ſuch wines do corrupt the blood by reaſon that nature draweth it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently from the ſtomack to the Liver, before it bee well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and before the ſuperfluity thereof be riped &amp; (through the great dulcetneſſe thereof, it filleth the bloud with vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted watcineſſe, that maketh the bloud apt to boyle, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie. And this alſo ſhould be underſtood by other meates, that are excéeding ſweet.</p>
            <p>And further know, that by the uſe of ſwéet wines, and other dulce nouriſhments three inconveniences are to be feared, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall in them that are inclined thereto.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Loathing: for all ſweet foods, through their heate and moyſture,<note place="margin">Three incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſecond thing is, theſe dulce foods do ſwiftly enflame and turn into choller<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for dulce things are moſt apt to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115892:24"/>ingender choller. Therefore honey (above all other things) ſooneſt ingendreth choller, becauſe it is of ſweet things the moſt ſweeteſt; <hi>And next to Honey is ſweete Wine.</hi> (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth.) And hereupon riſeth thirſtineſſe:<note place="margin">Gal. in comen cau. <hi>3.</hi> par. reg. acul.</note> for it is not wholeſome for them that have the Ague, nor for chollericke folks.</p>
            <p>The third is Opilation, or ſtopping of the Lyver and Splene: For theſe two members (and eſpecially the Liver) do draw dulce things with their Dregges unto them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great delight that they have in them before they bee digeſted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in theſe partes they lightly cauſe Opilations: <hi>Through the help &amp; operation of the groſſe ſubſtance. wherein the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourineſſe of ſweetneſſe is grounded,</hi> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth.<note place="margin">avi. <hi>2</hi> ca. tract <hi>1.</hi> ca. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> And this is the cauſe that ſweet wine doth leſſe provoke one to vrin, then other Wines.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ents, eager, ſharp, or ſavory things are very wholeſome: for with their Tarineſſe, they provoke the appetite, and with their coldneſſe they quench in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, and with their fineneſſe of ſubſtance, they open opilations. Further know, that although ſweet wines and other dulce nouriſhments, do ſtoppe or ſhut the Lyver, and Splene; yet they unſtop the Lungs. And the reaſon why they ſtop not the Lungs as well as the Liver and the Splene <hi>Galen</hi> declareth: <hi>Becauſe dulce things (in their paſſage) reſide notihng thereto, but that which is fine and pure:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. <hi>3.</hi> per reg acut.</note> and the bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of dulce things, commeth to the Lungs, putrified firſt in the Liver, and fined in the heart, Alſo, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">Hi. <hi>3</hi> par reg acut ca, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem levins, &amp;c</note> 
               <hi>Dulce wines do leaſt make one drunk,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may conclude, that if Wine be drunke for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, for a reſtorative of the Body, or to make them fat that be lean, whether it be naturally or accidentally; then dulce wines and groſſe, ſufficiently coloured, are wholeſome. For ſuch wines as are nouriſhments and reſtoratives, for ſuch
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115892:25"/>as be low brought: wherefore they are moſt convenient to make lean bodies fat. But ſuch as will not nouriſh, reſtore, nor make fat their bodies as they that be corſie and fat alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: then, though they may not uſe ſweet wines, but ſubtile, yet they ought to chuſe ſuch as be amiable, and have a good ſwo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This text teacheth one doctrine, the which is this, if a man be diſeaſed by drinking of Wine over night, let him on the morning afreſh drink Wine again. For either drinking of wine over night cauſeth drunkenneſs, thirſt in the morning, or elſe inflamation of the body: If it enflame the body, then it is right vnwholeſome, again in the morning to drink Wine afreſh, for that were as one ſhould lay fire to fire: but if one happen to be drunk, and therewith pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And although the immoderate drinking of Wine cauſeth the aforeſaid inconveniences: yet Wine moderately taken is wholeſome divers wayes. And <hi>Avicen</hi> rehearſeth five benefits enſuing by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">Five benefits by wine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately drunk.</note> that it eaſily conveyeth the meat that is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glad with it, to all the members of the body, through the hot ſubtilty, and hid convenient property therof.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, it digeſteth and reſolveth Phlegme, through the heat and ſubtilty of his ſubſtance, and maketh it apt to avoid o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, openeth the wayes, and comforteth nature to drive it out.</p>
            <p>Tho third is, it avoydeth red choller by vrine, and by other inſenſible evacuations, as ſweat and ſuch like.

            <p>The fourth thing is, it cauſeth melancholineſſe (the which is groſſe and moveth ſlowly) eaſtly to paſſe through the pipes or conduits thereof, from the Lyver to the Spleene, and from the Spleene to the brimine or mouth of the ſtomacke, and at laſt, with the dregs to avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fifth thing is, it reſolveth all cauſes of wearineſſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be mixt with ſome other meat. For Wine reviveth the reſolute ſpirits again abundantly, and doth comfort naturall vertue and taketh away or diminiſheth humidities that be left or remain in the muskles, in the ſinewes of the hearts, or in the joynts. And if the body be dryed by wearineſs, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moyſtning. Wine moyſtneth quickly, ſo it be allayed with water.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, beſides theſe things, Wine hath many other good properties. For above all other things, Wine is a ſwift and a ſudden nouriſhet: it comforteth the heat and naturall ſpirits, and heateth all the body: it cleareth the wit, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth anger, it driveth away headineſſe, and provoketh bodily luſt.

            <p>This Text declareth one ſpeciall Doctrine of Wine, and that is this; The better that Wine is, the better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours it engendreth. The reaſon is, becauſe black Wine is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115892:31"/>more groſſe and earthy, then any other: and therefore the Spirits thereof ingendred muſt needs be groſſe. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth: <hi>Groſſe Spirits make the Body heavy, or flow.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there be ſeven doctrines rehearſed, touching the election of wine.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Wine ought to be clear, becauſe wine,<note place="margin">VII doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>The third leſſon is, that Wine ought to be ſubtile. For ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile wine maketh the ſpirits of man ſubtile, and groſs wines ingender groſſe ſpirits.</p>
            <p>The fourth doctrine is. Wine ſhould be ripe, and not vert, or eager, or elſe it will deprive man of his naturall vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and good health, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fifth doctrine is, that wine ſhould be allayed with Water: for thereby the ſumoſity of the Wine, is put away, and ſo it doth leſſe over-come the brain. This is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The ſixth Doctrine is, Wine ſhould be ſprinkling when one taſteth it, aad this is one of the conditions of good wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Doctrine is conſidered in the Drinkers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not of the Wine; that is, one ought to drink wine temperately. For, Wine temperately taken ſharpeneth the wit, and ingendreth all the wholeſome things before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>By all theſe things here expreſſed, we may conclude, that wine that ought to be choſen, and is beſt in the Regiment of Health, if it be meane Wine, equall betweens old and new, cleere, ſomewhat red, of good odour and flavour, of equall ſavour; that is, neither eager, ſharp nor ſweet, which is not groſſe nor too much ſubtill, and beſide; that it be not too ſtrong, nor too weak, and that it grow not on ſtony and hilly ground, nor on ſimple, plain, and arable grounds, but on high ground, lying open towards the South, in a Country not too hot, nor too cold.</p>
            <p>Touching the Regiment of Wine concerning the ages: the Rules that <hi>Avicen</hi> giveth are to be well noted.</p>
            <p>The firſt is to give Children to drink Wine, is as it one would lay fire to fire, made of dry Wood. For Children be tender, and ſoon enflamed, through the abundance of their naturall heat, and their ſinewes and braines be weake and feeble. Wherefore Wine hurteth them many wayes, but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by quick inflamation by hurting of the Brain, by lightly piercing of the ſinewes, and abundant ſumoſity. Therefore, when giving children wine to drink, the enflaming heat of the wine is added to the flaming heat of their bodies, which are of as ſmall reſiſtance, as dry Sticks, Reed, or Tow, is againſt the fire.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Rule is, that one may give an old man as much Wine to drinke, as he can heare without hurt, that is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115892:32"/>as much as is naturall and due appetite deſireth. For like as old Bootes and Buskins (that be dry and wrinckled) are made ſupple and plain with oyling: fo likewiſe old Folkes by drinking of choſen Wine, as Wine of <hi>Benvoys.</hi> Ancient folkes are cold, and wine heateth: their ſpirit is heavy, and they be full of Melancholly, and VVine maketh them merry, and repreſſeth Melanchollineſs. And commonly, old Folkes ſleepe ill, and Wine maketh them ſleepe well, Old Folks be diſpoſed, to Oyllations, and Wine openeth. And like as Wine is to children moſt contrary, ſo for old folk it is moſt wholeſome.</p>
            <p>The third rule is, that young folks ſhould drinke Wine temperately, which temperately is to be vnderſtood in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable quantity, and with convenient allaying with water, And although that young folks are as hote as Children, yet their Members are more ſound, and their ſinewes and brain farre more ſtronger, whereby they may the ſtronglyer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the hurt that commeth by drinking of Wine. Much good comes by drinking of Wine ſoberly, thet is to ſay; the voiding of cholier, the quick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The firſt is that if it be not ſower for that hurteth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.

            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115892:33"/>

And therefore he that will drink wine in Summer, ſhould mingle it well with water, and forbear old and ſtrong wine.</p>

            <p>For by reaſon that nature is then but féeble, it is not able to weld and digeſt it: and too much allaying with water, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth naturall heat, and increaſeth ventoſities, whereby the collick is ingendred.</p>

            <p>And this is verified in big bodyes, and fleſhy and not in bare and féeble: for in ſuch bodies coldneſſe of winter being inclined, doth not comfort them with heat but rather maketh them more féeble: For in Winter, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſayth, <hi>Bellyes be hotteſt of nature and ſleep moſt long.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that the groſſe nouriſhments and hardeſt of digeſtion, are more wholeſome in winter then in other ſeaſons, becauſe the heat is ſtronger.

            <p>And here is to be noted, that as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, <hi>A Traveller on the Sea ſhould not much go about to withſtand, or to forbear perbreaking or caſting, at the beginning, but to vomit, untill he think himſelf well purged, becauſe that it preſerveth him from many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi>

            <p>The firſt is Sage,<note place="margin">To make a common ſauce.</note> wherewith we may make ſauce for a Gooſe roſt or ſod. For commonly a Gooſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Likewiſe of Sage, vplandiſh folke make a ſauce to eat with a Mooſe: for they ſtamp Sage and Garlike together, that the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115892:36"/>Sage may abate ſomewhat of the Garlickes favour.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing, is ſalt mixt with wine, and this Sauce is for rich and Noblemen. For when they want Muſtard, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> they put Wine in a Saucer, and mingle it with a little Salt.</p>
            <p>The third thing, is Pepper, a Sauce for vplandiſh folks: for they mingle Pepper with Beanes and Peaſe. Likewiſe of toaſted bread with Ale or Wine, and with Pepper, they make a black ſauce, as if it were Pay, that is called Pepper, and that they caſt vpon their meat, fleſh and fiſh.</p>
            <p>The fourth is Garlick; whereof the vplandiſh People make a Sauce, for they mingle ſoft cheeſe and milk and ſtamp Garlike together, and ſo they eat it with their meat whether it be roſted or ſod, ſalt or freſh and with hard Egges.</p>
            <p>The fift thing is Perſley; of Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And here is to be noted, that Sauce or Sauces do vary, according to the Seaſons of the Year. For to ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Seaſons Sauce muſt be made of cold things, or of ſtuffe of little heat; and in cold ſeaſons contrariwiſe. Therefore Summer Sauce ſhould be Verjuyce, Eyzell or Vinegar, the juyce of Lemons or of Pomgranates, with Roſe-water and ſuch like And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while in Sauces made in Summer, one may put a little Pellitory and Parſley to attemper the coldneſſe of the foreſaid things.

            <p>Secondly, Sauces differ by reaſon of the meats for which they be made: for one meate will haue one Sauce; an other meate an other Sauce; as Lords Cookes know. Sauce for Mutton, Meals and Kid, is gréene Sauce, mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In winter the ſame ſauces, are made with many ſpices, and little quantity of Garlick, and of the beſt Wine, and with a little Verjuyce or with Muſtard: Sauce for roaſted bref is made with pepper, toaſted bread, broath of fleſh and Grapes, and the ſame ſauce is good in Winter to once with Pork, Alſo Pork in ſummer may be eaten with vinegar and parſley at the beginning of dinner.</p>
            <p>But in caſe, that the foreſaid meats be baked and ſpecially beef and pork, and in winter, then ſerve in a white onion and a ſmall quantity of ſwéet ſpice, beaten in powder But in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſerve it in without onions and with verjoyce or elſe with a few ſmal onions.

            <p>But in winter inſtead of verjuyce, take wine and more ſpice, with roaſted rabbets and chickens, ſauce made with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon crums of bread, and with verjuce, in ſummer ſeaſon is wholeſome and in winter with wine.</p>

            <p>In this Text two things are touched or remembred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the choice of bread.</p>
            <p>The firſt is heat;<note place="margin">Five proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of good bread.</note> becauſe Bread ought not to be eaten hot. <hi>Hot bread</hi> (as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith) <hi>is not convenient for mans nature, and bread that commeth hote from the Oven is now unwholeſome:</hi> the reaſon is; <hi>becauſe it ſtoppeth much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again after he ſaith; <hi>That hot bread cauſeth thirſtineſſe, by reaſon that it is hot:</hi> For it ſwimmeth in the ſtomack by reaſon of his vaporous humidity: yet it is of quick digeſtion, and deſendeth down ſtoutly. And although that hot bread in the Regiment of Health be unwholeſome to eat: yet the ſmell thereof is right wholeſome; for it relieveth one in a ſwound: and it is poſſible that ſome folk may live by the ſmel of new Bread.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, we ought not to eat bread that is very ſtale or mouldy; for ſuch bread is vnwholeſome for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of mans nature: becauſe it dryeth the body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth melancholy humours; whereupon it followeth, <hi>That bread ſhould not be too new, nor too ſtale, but a day old.</hi> Further, this Text declareth five properties of good bread.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, it muſt be well leavened as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. The Bread of digeſtion is it that is well leavened, and baked in an Oven that is heated with moderate fire.</p>
            <p>And again he ſaith; <hi>Unleavened bread is wholeſome for no body.</hi> And after the mind of <hi>Avicen, Bread made with little leven nouriſheth much;</hi> But the nouriſhment thereof is a ſtopper, except they eat it that labour much.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, that bread ought to be light; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is known that the clammineſſe thereof is gone: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe this kind of bread after the mind of <hi>Avicen, Is the ſwift enterer, and of leſſe and worſe nouriſhment,</hi> even as bread that is made of ſuth Bran.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:115892:38"/>
            <p>The third thing is, that Bread ought to be well baked, for bread that is ill baked, is ill of digeſtion, and engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth griefe in the ſtomacke And <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. <hi>That bread ill baked nouriſheth very much but the nouriſhments cauſeth opila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, except they labor much that eat it.</hi> And bread baked on a ſtone or in a pan is of the ſame faſhion: for it is never wel ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked within.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is, that bread ought to be temperately ſalted. For bread over-ſweet it a ſtopper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bread over ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is a dryer: but bread moderately nouriſheth beſt, is that if have the other conditions.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing is, that bread ſhould be made of the beſt grain that is to ſay of the beſt wheat.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Author in this Text warneth us, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of cruſts eating becauſe they ingender a duſt cholor, or melancholly humours, by reaſon that they be burned, and dry. And therefore great eſtates, the which the chollerick of nature, cauſe the cruſts above and beneath to be chipped away wherefore the pith or crumme ſhould be choſen, the which is of a greater nouriſhment, then the cruſt. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cruſtes hee wholeſome for them that bee whole, and have their ſtomacke moyſt, and deſire to be leane, but they muſt eat them after they have dined, becauſe they enforce the meate to deſcend downe, and comfort the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</p>
            <p>Further in the two laſt verſes is ſhewed, that good bread ought to have theſe five conditions, that is to ſay. It muſt be well ſalted, leavened well baked made of good clean corne, that us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipe gathered bound vp in ſheaf and houſed in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon And here is to be noted, that if one deſire to nouriſh his body, be muſt have his bread made of pure flowr, the bran clean taken out but he that deſtreth to be lean, muſt leave ſome bran therein: for bran nouriſheth but little, and vnlooſeth the belly, and flower doth contrariwiſe.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Here the Author ſhe weth five inconveniences that breed by drinking of new Wine or Muſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that Muſt hindereth or letteth the vrine: and this may be vnderſtood two wayes. Firſt by reaſon that Muſt is thick and groſſe, it mingleth wita the dregs, and ſo ſtoppeth the Liver and the Reynes; ſo that the vrine cannot eaſily have his courſe. Secondly, it letteth the brine to have due courſe, even as Reniſh Muſt doth, and certain other ſubtile Wines likewiſe.</p>
               <p>For there is ſome Reniſh Muſt, of the which the Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s are mordicant and biting: and while it runneth into the Bladder, and conſtrain one to vrine contrary to the due order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he was wont to do.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, it loſeth the belly, by reaſon that it ſcoureth the entrayls and through ſharpneſſe of the Lees it pricketh the guis, and cauſeth the or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es to avoid out: Firſt, by reaſon that the Lets be mord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cative: Secondly, thorow the ventoſity, which ſuch Wine cauſeth: and thirdly, by reaſon that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the guts ſlippery by way of vndigeſtibleneſſe and grief of the ſtomack.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the ſtomack loſeneth and openeth the ways that were ſhut.</p>
               <p>The third inconvenience is, that muſt burteth the good complexion of the Liver: For it ſtoppeth the Liver through much mingling of the Lees, and cauſeth a diſeaſe in the Liver, called <hi>Diſenteria,</hi> onely through ſwelling, whereby the Liver is enſeebled. Thus <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith. And thus it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115892:40"/>ingendreth all ill colour, and all diſeaſes of the Liver, that is to ſay, ſpices of the Dropſie.</p>
               <p>The fourth inconvenience is that moſt hurteth the Spléen and the diſpoſttion thereof, through the ſame cauſe that it doth the Liver; for it ſtoppeth the Spleen, and ſo cauſeth it to be hard.</p>
               <p>The fifth hurt is that Muſt ingendreth the Stone, land eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which is in the Rains, which is ruddy, and lightly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ble, by reaſon of opilation, that it cauſeth through the groſſe ſubſtance thereof. And this is very certain, it the Muſt be of very ſwéet Wines, whoſe Lées be nothing biting or ſharp. For Muſt that hath ſharp and biting Lées, preſerveth a man from the Stone, becauſe it maketh one to vrine often: like as ſome Reniſh Muſt doth, that cauſeth Sand or Gravell to be ſeen in the vrine: the which doth often provoke one to make water. This often making water; waſheth away the ſmall Gravell that cleaveth to the mans Reyns, and ſo be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydeth it.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, drinking of Water hurteth ones ſtomack that eateth: by reaſon that Water cooleth and looſeneth the ſtomack and eſpecially it deſtroyeth the appetite.</p>
               <p>The ſecond hurt is, dringking of Water with meat, letteth digeſtion, for it maketh the meat that is then eaten to be caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh after the mind of <hi>Avicen.</hi> For as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith <hi>Much Water ſhould not be drunk after meat; becauſe it divideth the ſtomack and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115892:40"/>the meat, and cauſeth it to ſwim in the ſtomack.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>That when Nature dath digeſt meat, and that a ſufficient quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is mingled therewith: then it we drink more Water after that, it letteth very much the digeſtion that was begin.</hi>

                  <hi>That drinking of water ſhould be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, except it be to help the meat down, when it ſlicketh or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth ſlowly; but with meat water ſhould never be taken or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Averroes</hi> in his Comment, ſheweth the reaſon, and ſaith, <hi>To drink water upon the meat maketh the ſtomack cold ere it be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hote: and maketh the meat rawiſh, and alſo it cauſeth the meat to ſwim in the ſtomack, and will not let it ſtick faſt, whereas it ſhould conveniently digeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The operation of the ſtomack is, to make a good mixtion of things received therein and to digeſt them well.</p>
               <p>That done, there followeth an ordinary and a naturall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of pure and vnpure things. And as agreat quantity of water being put into a Pot, ſlaketh the ſeething of the meate therein: ſo likewiſe it chanceth in the ſtomack by drinking of much water.</p>

               <p>The ſecond hurt is, to drinke water after great labour and travell, and likewiſe ater the fleſhly act between man
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115892:41"/>and woman: for then the pores of the body be very open, whereby the water entreth into the bottome of the members, and mortifieth the naturall heat, which heat alſo (after the fleſhly act) is weakned.</p>
               <p>The third inconvenience is, to drink water after baining, ſpecially if one bain himſelf faſting: for then the candites and paſſages of the body he very open; wherefore the water then entring into them, hurteth much, as is aforeſaid.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The fiſh of Pike is hard, and a Pike is ſwift in ſmim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a Perch derived of this Verb <hi>Parco, pardis</hi> to forbear, or to ſpare, but by a contrary ſenſe: for a Perch ſpareth no fiſh, but woundeth other fiſhes with his fins on his back, nor a Pike dare not adventure vpon a Perch, but as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is a naturall amity between the Pearch and the Pike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if the Pike be once hurt of another fiſh, he is healed with great difficulty. And when he is hurt he goeth vnto the Pearch, the which ſeeing him hurt, toucheth and ſucketh his wound, and ſo the Pike is healed again. And the Pearch is likewiſe an hard Fiſh,</p>
               <p>The third is a Sole or Sea Fiſh, called a Sold, which is a ſpecial good fiſh.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:115892:45"/>
               <p>The fourth is a Whiting.</p>
               <p>The fith is a Tench, which is a freſh water fiſh, and the skinne thereof is ſlippery and ſlimy, and ſomewhat black, and the meat thereof is hard. Whenſoever one will dreſſe a Pike, a Pearch, or a Tench, hee muſt take the skinne away.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is a <hi>Gurnus,</hi> which is a Sea fiſh. This Fiſh is as great in quantity as a mans middle finger, the which is eaten with the head and fins,</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is a Playce.</p>
               <p>The eighth is a Carpe, a freſh water fiſh, the which is much ſlimy: but great eſtates have them ſod in wine, and ſo the ſlimineſs is away.</p>
               <p>The ninth is a Rochet a Sea-fiſh, and it is a Fiſh of hard meat and wholſome. Some other texts have <hi>Govio,</hi> that is a Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on, which is a very wholſome fiſh.</p>
               <p>The Tenth is a Trout, the which (in eating) is like a Salmon, and yet it is no Salmon: It is long and not groſſe, it is taken in great Rivers, and will ſuffer it ſelf to he rubbed and clawed, being in the water, and ſo it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thereof Paſties be made with ſpices, and it is a right dainty fiſh.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the choice of fiſh, yee ſhall firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that fiſh (if it bee compared to Fleſh) is of leſſe nouriſhment, and is lighter of digeſtion, and the nouriſhment thereof is full of phlegmatick ſuperfluities, cold and moyſt, and they be hardly digeſted, and abide long in the Stomackc. And by reaſon that the Stomack laboureth in digeſting them, and that otherwhile they bée corrupted in the Stomack; they retaine a certain putrified quality, and engender thirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And ſurely, the nouriſhment of wholeſome fleſh is better then fiſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, know, that Sea-fiſh is better in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Health, then any other of the ſame ſort, which is taken in freſh water. For their nouriſhment is not ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and yet is more nearer to the nature of fleſh.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115892:45"/>But becauſe Sea fiſh is harder, then other of the ſame ſort,<note place="margin">Conditions of good fiſh.</note> that is taken in freſh Water; therefore it is of more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in digeſtion, and of more pure nouriſhment. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding freſh water fiſh is more wholſomer for ſick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lk by reaſon of their feeble digeſtion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly fiſh, as well of Salt water as freſh, ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatly choſen: the which when it is dreſſed is white, and not clammy, that is brittle, and not very groſſe; it muſt have a good ſavour, that doth not ſoon putrifie, and of a good colour. Nor it may not be bred in Lakes or ponds, nor in filthy places nor in water wherein groweth ill weeds. And they ought not to bet too old nor too young, they ſhould be ſwift of moving, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſmall clammiſhnes.</p>
               <p>But if it be Sea-fiſh, we muſt chooſe ſuch as are taken in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a good way from the Sea, and ſuch as have the other afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid conditions. And the more skaly that Fiſh is, the better it is, and ſo it is likewiſe vnderſtood by the fins; for many fins and ſkales betoken the pureneſſe of the fiſhes ſubſtance. Alſo among ſea fiſh, they be beſt that that are bred in the déepeſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the which ebbeth and floweth. And therefore the Fiſh that it taken in the North Sea, that is more ſurging, and more tempeſtuous, and more ſwift in ebbing and flowing is better, then the fiſh that is taken in the dead or the South Sea.</p>
               <p>And ye ſhall likewiſe vnderſtand of freſh water fiſh: for fiſh bred in deep water is better then the other of the ſame ſort being bred in ſhallow waters, and little brooks. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may ſufficiently be known, what kind of fiſh ſhould be choſen. For beſtiall fiſh, ſuch as the Sea Swine, Dog-fiſh and Dolphin, are vnwholeſome in the Regiment of Health, becauſe they be hard of digeſtion, and of ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>Nor in the meate of the aforeſaid Fiſhes, the above numbred conditions appears not, as whiteneſſe, ſubtility, no ſuch other. For it thoſe Fiſhes (and ſuch like) chance to be eaten, they ſhould not be ſod ſo ſoone as they bée taken:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115892:46"/>but they ſhould be kept a few dayes after, till time the meat of them do mollifie and ware tender, without corrupting of their ſubſtance. And alſo the aforeſaid fiſhes be heifer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little corned with Salt, then freſh, or viterly ſalt,</p>
               <p>Now among all Sea-fiſh (the aforeſaid conditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at of thoſe two is more clammy, leſſe frangible, leſſe white, more groſſe; and leſſe ſubtile: Nor the ſavour and ſmell is not ſo delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Some hold, that the Whyting is more commendable then the rochet. It is not ſo clammy as a Plaice and a Sole and the meat thereof is frangible enough, but the reliſh ſmel, colour, pureneſſe of ſubſtance and mobility conſidered, it is not to good as a rochet and gurnard,</p>
               <p>The like ye ſhall vnderſtand of Herring, and the fiſh called <hi>Morua,</hi> being young enough, they draw neare to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd fiſhes in goodneſſe, ſo that they have the above ſayd conditions: yet they are groſſer and more clammy then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid aſhes.</p>
               <p>But as for Salmon, Tuthut and Makerell, they are not ſo good, becauſe they be much groſſe, more clammy, hard of digeſtion, and fuller of ſuperfluity. Therefore they bee onely wholeſome for Labourers, and young folkes of ſtrong complexion: and their clammineſſe, groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and coldneſſe may be taken away with certaine ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Among freſh Water Fiſh (the foreſaid conditions conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earch and the Pike are the beſt, ſo that they bée fat: and next to them are the Vendoſies, and then Lobſters. And though the Pearch be more ſhaly then the foreſaid fiſhes: yet the meat thereof is as white frangible, and ſubtile, as the Pike and Carp, as it is oft found in ponds.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:115892:46"/>
               <p>Now vniverſally the beſt freſh water Fiſh of the ſame ſort, is that which is taken in water that is ſtony in the bottom, running Northward, deep, and labouring much whereunto runneth no ordures of the Cities, and wherein no Weedes grow,</p>
               <p>Creveſces both of the ſea and rivers, are very nutritive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not lightly corrupt the ſtomack: but they be hard of digeſtion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore note, that freſh Fiſh doth m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here the Authour teacheth two things. The firſt is, that one at dinner and ſupper ſhould eate well, and drink oft, and yet but a little at once: and not to do as a bruit beaſt doth, that eateth hie fill of meat, and drinketh after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for the better the drink to mingled with the meat, the ſooner the meat is mollified, &amp; the more capable of digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Now here is to be noted, that there are three manner of drinkings. The firſt is that which mingleth the meat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſecond is that which dilateth. The third is that which quencheth the thirſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt that wée ſpeake of, is to bée vnderſtood of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115892:48"/>drinke mingled with our meate, though wee bee not thirſty, Thus we ought to drinke, even as we have eaten a little. For (except a better reaſon) I ſay, we may not abide till the meates end, nor till we be a thirſt. And this manner of drinking is ſpecially good for them, which féed on meat that is actually dry: as appeareth by ſick folkes, that eat dry bread.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as be in good temper, ſhould not drink to quench their thirſt, till the meals end: for then commeth the true thirſt, by reaſon the meat is hot and dry. <hi>It is not very reaſonable, that thirſt and hunger ſhould aſſayl us both together: for they are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appetite.</hi> And thus one ſhould drink, according as the thirſt is more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>Drinking dilative, is moſt convenient after the firſt digeſtion regularly, and a little before wee take other meate. And this manner of drinking is wholeſome, when the meates (before taken) be groſſe in ſubſtance: nor thus to drinke we may not tarry till we be thirſty. For this drinking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xareth the ſtomacke to receive other meate, and cauſeth the meat that is digeſted, to depart from the ſtomack to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: nor this drinking ſhould not be in any great quantity, to the end it may be the ſooner digeſted. For before it be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, it goeth not to the liver: <hi>And this is of truth, except ſuch drink dilative be water, in which we muſt not tarry till digeſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to the Liver.</hi> But regularly, convenient drink dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or permixtive. ought to be wine, Ale, Béer, Perry, or ſuch like, but wine is beſt of all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the groſſer, dryer, and colder the meat is, the ſtronger the drinke permixtive and dilative ſhould be. And contrariwiſe, the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the more ſubtile, hote and digeſtible the meat is, the weaker the drink or wine ought to be. Wherfore one ought to drink ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wine with beef then with Chickens, and ſtronger Wine with fiſh then with fleſh.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Here the Authour ſaith, that Peaſon ſome way may bee vnwholeſome. They bee very wholſome to eate when the huskes be taken away: for if they bee eaten in the huskes they inflate. And therefore it is not artificiall to eat them in the husks, becauſe the nature of that within, and the husks do diſagree: for the one laboureth to bee looſed and to goe out, but the other withſtandeth and bindeth, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Wherefore they cauſe a rumbling, gnawing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation in the belly. Yet Peaſon onely do not this, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all Pulſe, as Beanes, Chyches, Cheſtons, and ſuch like, and ſpecially ſuch as have much huek, as beans and black rice. Alſo the husk of them all nouriſheth worſe then the pith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Now here is to be noted, that there is a manner of white round Peaſon, whereof the cod is very ſmall and thin: and one may eate theſe Peaſon (with the husk) more ſurely then other, although it were better to hull them.

               <p>Further the ſubſtance of all pulſe is inflative, and hard of digeſtion, and their ill nouriſhment is vnwholſome in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Health: but the broth of them is wholeſom, becauſe the broth maketh the belly laxative, and precureth vrine, and vnſtoppeth the veins.

               <p>The ſecond is, that butter is moiſt, for it is made of the beſt parts of the milk, wherefore it muſt needs be moiſt, ſeeing that the milk is moiſt whereof it is made.</p>
               <p>The third is, that it looſeth the belly, and that is by the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſſe that it cauſeth in the gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth loathſomneſſe: and maketh the meat to ſwim about the brim of the ſtomack: and laxeth the belly out of meaſure, and provoketh one to vomit: therefore butter ſhould in no wiſe (as meat) be eaten in any great quantity and ſpecially it ſhould not be eaten after other meat, but to vſe it with other it is very wholeſome.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt is that Chéeſe is naturally cold. And this is to be vnderſtood of gréen Cheeſe, the which is cold and moiſt, and not of old Cheeſe, the which is hot and dry, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. Or elſe it may be vnderſtood of Chéeſe that cruddeth onely of the milk, without mingling of any other thing, for there is ſome Chéeſe naturally hot, that heateth the ſtomack and biteth the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond property is that Chéeſe maketh one coſtive, and this is of truth ſpecially if it be hard and made with much renles.</p>
               <p>The third property is, that all Chéeſe engendreth groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: for all Cheeſe is ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth property is, that Cheeſe bindeth the wombe

               <p>Further the Text ſayth, that though Cheeſe that is eaten alone, be vnwholſome by reaſon that it cauſeth ill digeſtion: yet if one eat a little thereof with bread, if ſhall digeſt with the bread, and not otherwiſe.

               <p>The ſecond leſſon is, that between meales one muſt forbear drink, eſpecially, if the meat that he did eat be vndigeſted in the ſtomack except neceſſity conſtrain him to drink; for drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then, lotteth and breaketh digeſtion of the meat that is before eaten. For it cauſeth the meat to deſcend from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack vndigeſted, and marreth the appetite, it grieveth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and engeadreth the Fevers, and other Diſeaſes.</p>

                     <l>With drink begin thy Supper. Others ſay,</l>
                     <l>Till thou have eaten firſt, keep drink away.</l>
                     <l>The Comment therefore yeelds the beſt direction</l>

                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>Here the Author ſaith, that one ought to begin his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with drink Some expound this verſe thus. If thou w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> eſchew ſickneſſe, drinke at Supper ere thou begin to eat. But this expoſition is reprooved. For after the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Phyſſtians a man ſhould begin his Supper with meat. and not with drink. And although this book was made for Engliſhmen yet they keep not this rule: for at what hoar of the day ſoever they drink, they eat firſt a morſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore this verſe may be expounded otherwiſe: taking drink for meat moiſt and eaſſe of digeſtion, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth drink when be ſayth, <hi>It is eaſier to fill one with drink then with meat.</hi> So that the ſentence of this verſe ſhould be thus. It is better to begin our ſupper with drink, that is with meat moiſt and eaſſe of digeſtion, then with meat that is groſſe, hard, and of ill digeſtion. The reaſon is if one eat meat, that is moiſt and eaſie of digeſtion, after meat that is groſs, and hard of digeſtion, by reaſon of the digeſtive heat of the night, it will be digeſted long before the groſs meats. And when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (for the groſs meat that is vndigeſted) have iſſue it burneth over-much: or if it get iſſue, it plucketh with if ſome part of the groſſe meat that is vndigeſted. Therefore it is beſt to begin with meat moiſt and eaſie of digeſtion: that when it is digeſted, if may (without let) iſſue out.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, to drink a good draught of Wine; after one hath eaten a new laid Egge rere roaſted, is very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The reaſon may be, becauſe a new laid Egge rere roaſted, is of right great nouriſhment, and eaſily digeſteth, and it is of that ſort, that in ſmal quantity it nouriſheth much: and principally the yolk, as is before ſayd at <hi>Ova recentia.</hi> So that the wine, which is friendly of nature, cauſeth that the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is more deſtrouſly drawn by the nouriſhing members: and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it to enter. Another cauſe may be. An Egg deſcendeth ſlowly down: and drink helpeth it to deſcend.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Doctrine is, to eat nuts after Fiſh inſtead of chéeſe. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ts, by reaſon of their drineſſe, hindreth the engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of phlegm, that is wont to be engendred of fiſh. And for this cauſe, nuts are the laſt ſervice in Lent.</p>
               <p>The third leſſon is, that after fleſh, we nuſt eat Cheeſe and not nuts, for nuts do dry over much, and ſo doth not chéeſe: but it cauſeth the meat to deſcend to the bottom of the ſtomack where the vertue of digeſtion is. And this is certain, it the cheeſe be neither too old, nor too new.</p>

               <p>Secondly he ſaith, that nuts are a remedy againſt venom: as it hath been ſhewed at <hi>Alia nux, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, in the ſecond and third verſe; he ſheweth, that Pears that be eaten without Wine, are denemous, that is, hurtfull to mans nature, The cauſe is ſhewed in the firſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115892:54"/>verſe. Yet for all that, Peares be not venemous ſimply, for if they were they would kill us, and Pears (ſo doing) are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>In the fourth verſe be ſheweth that raw Peares, are vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that is to ſay, hurtful: for they make the humors to boil, and breed the chollick, fleam, and ſcab: yet if they be ſod, they be medicinable, in manner as is before ſaid, that is to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with wine: and ſpecially if they be eaten after other meat, for they expulſe the dregs.</p>
               <p>In the fifth verſe he ſaith, that raw Pears grieve the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack; for they hinder digeſtion, and enflate: but ſod Pears relieve the Stomack that is grieved, and diſpoſe it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:115892:54"/>
               <p>The firſt is, that Cherries purgeth the ſtomack.<note place="margin">Eating of cherries.</note> This ſome ſay is truth, when that the ſtones he broken and eaten withall: for theſe two together by their naturall property, do ſecure and cleanſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that the kernell of the Cherry ſtone, by ſelf-vertue, breaketh the ſtones in ones reins, for bladder, and if it be eaten dry or made in milk.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the ſubſtance, or meat of Cherries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth very good bloud, and it comforteth and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eth the body. And this is proved by experience, for we ſée that Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which are great eaters of Cheries, in Chery-time their livers be far greater then in other ſeaſons, whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that Cherries increaſe and comfort the Liver.</p>
               <p>Yet here is to bee noted, that there bee two ſorts of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, groſſe and ſmall. And alſo of the groſſer, there are two ſorts ſome are ſweet, and ſome ſowre. All dulce, and ſmall Cheries are vnwholſome, for they be lightly corrupt, and bréed vermine. The groſſe, and ſowr Cheries are called <hi>Cina,</hi> and of theſe are two ſorts.</p>
               <p>Some be ruddy and ſoft of ſubſtance, and ſuch muſt bée eaten freſh and new gatherèd, and at beginning of dinner, their nature is to ſcowr the ſtomack, and to provoke the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p>The other be black, groſſe, and hard of ſubſtance, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſower. And theſe ſhould be eaten after dinner, or ſupper. The cauſe is, for by their ſowernes they cloſe the month of the ſtomack, whereby the better and ſpeedier digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followeth.</p>

               <p>Here the Author reciteth two utilities, that come by eating of Prunes.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:115892:55"/>
               <p>Firſt, Prunes coole the body, and therefore <hi>Portugals</hi> that dwell in a hot Country, ſeeth Prunes alway with their meat.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Prunes make one to lask, by reaſon of their humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and clammineſſe, as Galen</hi> ſayth. This is truth, if they be ripe.<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>2</hi> alimen.</note> For Prunes that be ripe, be Stipticalli and nouriſh little, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. And though Damask-Prunes have the foreſaid vtility, yet properly they be aſcribed to Prunes of <hi>Armenia.</hi> For Prunes of the Country of <hi>Armenia,</hi> are better then any other, <hi>And they unbind the womb more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then any other,</hi>

                  </note> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth: yet know, that ripe Prunes are to be uſed, and not vnripe.</p>
               <p>The Prunes moſt wholeſome for mans Nature, be the long ones, that have little ſubſtance about the ſtone, ſmall, hard, and in manner dry, and the butter skin thin, and they ſhould not be ſweet in taſte, but ſomewhat ſowre, and of this ſort are Damask Prunes:<note place="margin">The beſt Prunes.</note> and theſe do refreſh and cools the body, as is ſaid.</p>
               <p>There be many other ſorts of Prunes, whoſe uſe is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>There be alſo Prunes, called wild Prunes, the which grow in the woods; theſe be not laxatide: of them water is diſtilled to bind the womb.</p>
               <p>Prunes that be taken to make one lask. muſt firſt be layd in cold water, for then they cool and moyſt more perfectly, and by their ſlipperineſſe they looſe the choller that they come to: and ſo the Stomack is better diſpoſed to receive food.</p>
               <p>And here is to be noted, that moiſt Prunes and new, are more alterative, though they be of leſs nouriſhment, and of more ſuperfluity: but dry Prunes comfort more, and better nouriſh the body. And as it is by Prunes, ſo after the ſame manner it is vnderſtood by Charries.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, the humidity of Cherries is ſubtile, and not clammy, whereby they nouriſt leſſe then Prunes.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, that with Peaches we ſhould drink Muſt,<note place="margin">To drink wine with peaches.</note> for two cauſes The firſt is, becauſe Muſt is hot, and boyleth in our body; which hoyling and heat fordeeth the coldneſſe of the Peach.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is, Peaches veright cold and cool the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very much. Therefore, that wine ſhould be drunk upon them, which beateth more then other, and that is Muſt which is known by experience. The manner how we ſhould eat Peaches and other fruits, is declared at <hi>Perſica Poma, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond doctrine is, that with old dry Nuts we Nuſt cat Rayſins. For new gathered Nuts are wholeſome alone: but old dry Nuts are great dryers, and through their vnctuoſity they lightly inflame the body: wherefore Rayſins with them muſt be eaten, which reſtrain inflammation and dryneſſe, by reaſon that they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gainſt three diſeaſes: that is to ſay, the Swines evill, Kernels and Swellings. By Swines evill is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Inſtation under the chinne about the throat. And it is called <hi>Scrofula a Scrofa:</hi> that is to ſay, a Sow or a Swine,<note place="margin">avi <hi>3 4</hi> traw, <hi>2</hi> ca de ſcroſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</note> 
                  <hi>Either becauſe this diſeaſe chanceth many times to Swine, through their guloſity, or elſe becauſe the ſlape of this diſeaſe is like to a Swine,</hi> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>By Kirnels are vnderſtood Impoſtumes, which commonly chaunce vnder the arme-pittes, and in the gruyne. And by ſwelling may be underſtood Inflations vnder any part of the body.<note place="margin">A plaiſter made of Figs.</note> Wherefore to heale Impoſtumes, and ſpecially to ripe them, Figges ſhould be ſodden in water, and with the water ſhould be mixed a little quantity of Vineger, the which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the vertue of figs to enter. And when it is ſub, the Figs muſt beaten in a Morter: and then mingled with a curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſle of water, that they were ſod in and ſo make a Playſter.

               <q>Cum ſuccum ponis &amp; herham, tune Cateplaſma facis.</q>
               <p>The ſecond vtility is, that a Playſter made of Figs and Poppy ſées joyneth or ſetteth broken bones together again,<note place="margin">a plaiſter of Ags and pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſeed.</note> and they muſt be ſod together in Water, without Vineger: and then ſlamp it in a Morter, and put thereto a little of the

               <p>The reaſon hereof may be, becauſe Poppy ſéed both taketh away the ſenſibleneſſe of the members whereby the ach (that is wont to chance in breaking of Bones) is done away, and proveketh one to ſléep. And the Figs do draw the humidities of the body to the vtter-parts: which humidities brought to the Bones will draw, retain or hold them together, but never perfectly knit them.</p>
               <p>Know withall, that there be thrée kinds of Poppies white, red, and black. The red is venemous, and groweth among Corn Young ſchollers are wont to ſtamp the flowers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo make red Ink.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, that they increaſe vrine: that is, by reaſon that they make the dregs hard, and ſo their waterines turns into much vrine.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vtility is that Medlars make one coſtive, by reaſon of their ſowerneſſs and Stipticity and therefore the text ſayth, that hard Medlars be the better to ſtop the lask: but yet the ſoft Medlars be better then the hard: for they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh more, and bind leſſe. And here is to be noted, that Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars nouriſh leſſe then Apples, Peares, Peaches, Figges, and ſuch like; which thing appeareth plainly, by the eagerneſs of reliſh or taſte, and hardneſſe of their ſubſtance, after they be ripe on the tree, and therefore we ſhould eat few Medlars, and rather in way of medicine, then meat. And becauſe Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ripe not on the tree ſoft enough to eat, they muſt be laid in ſtraw, till they be ſoft: and then they be more delectable, and leſſe ſtipticall.</p>

               <p>Here the Authour rehearſing two things, declareth eight properties of Ale or Beer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, that Ale ingendreth groſſe humours in mans body, which is of truth, in regard of Wine, And after the diverſity of corn or groſſe ſubſtance, that the Ale is made of; the groſſer humors it engendreth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Ale augmenteth mans ſtrength: and this doth Ale that is made of the beſt grain, and well ſod, for by reaſon that it nouriſheth much, it increaſeth ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is encreaſeth fleſh, by reaſon that it nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115892:58"/>much: and for the ſame cauſe it encreaſeth the bloud.</p>
               <p>And theſe thrée laſt properties be in ſtale Ale, that is well ſod and made of the beſt Grain.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it ſtirreth one to vrine.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it maketh one to lask. And theſe two properties be in clear Beer that hath much of the Hag, as Beer of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> which by reaſon of the Hops, it bringeth one in a lask: But it is not good for then: that have a weak brain: For, this Beer by reaſon of Hops, doth lightly overcome the Brain.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it inflateth the belly: this is of truth, if it be ill ſod, as <hi>Holland</hi> Beer doth which inflateth moſt, and ſtoppeth; and therefore it fatteth right much.</p>
               <p>The eighth is, that a little curtiſie of ale cooleth: So doth Béer of <hi>Holland, Braband, Heynault,</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and this is that we vſe daily, and this property is for certain, in reſpect of Wine.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that Ale may be made of Oats, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Wheat; and as the Grain is altered, ſo is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet that which is made of Barley, inclineth more to cold, for Barley is cold. Yet that which is made of Barley and Oats ſtoppeth leſſe, and leſſe engendreth ventoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ies, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth leſſe.</p>
               <p>But Ale made of Wheaten malt, enclineth more to heat, it nouriſheth more, and ſtoppeth more. And the groſſer the Ale is, the worſe it is the ſubtiler the better.</p>
               <p>Further, Ale that is made of things that maketh one drunk, is worſt, as of Darnell. For this Grain ſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth head: ach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ext are five properties of Vinegar.</p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">Avi. <hi>2.</hi> ca ea. de aceto. Avi. <hi>3 1</hi> a in ca. unico. doc v.</note> it dryeth. For <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a ſtrong dryer,</hi> And therefore Phyſitians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id (in the time of Peſtilence) to vſe it with meat and drink.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that uſeth Vinegar in his meat and drink in Peſtilence time, needeth not to dread the ſickneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that vinegar of his own property cooleth.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:115892:58"/>
               <p>Thirdly it maketh one lean, by reaſon that it dryeth: and and this is for a very truth. <hi>If one take it faſting,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">avi, <hi>3 8</hi> dec <hi>4</hi> ca. <hi>v.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth. Yet nevertheleſſe, the continuall vſe of Vinegar, ſpecially faſting, breedeth many inconveniences, it féebleth the ſight, it hurteth the breaſt, and cauſeth the Cough: it hurteth the ſtomack and Liver, and vehemently oppreſſeth the ſinews and joints, vering them with arthreticall griefs, with trembling and ſhaking.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Vinegar ingendreth Melancholy humours, by reaſon that it cooleth and drieth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Vinegar diminiſheth the ſeed of generation, for as much as it cooleth, dryeth and maketh one leane. Theſe ſayd properties <hi>Raſis</hi> putteth, ſaying. <hi>Vinegar is cold and drie, which maketh one lean, it deſtroyeth the ſtrength, it diminiſheth the ſeed of generation it enforceth black choller it maketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the laſt verſe the Author putteth three things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that Vinegar hurteth lean folks, by reaſon that it dryeth, and the tartneſſe maketh it to dry the more: For like joynd to like, maketh one the more ſurious. And alſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry decayed complexion is holp by the contrary, and by the like it is brought into worſe caſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Vinegar hurteth the ſinewes, and thirdly, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one lean, as is before ſaid.</p>

               <p>Firſt. Rapes comfort the ſtomack: for the ſtomack dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth them well and is not grieved therewith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Rapes breake wind, as appeareth by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

               <p>Here the Author reciteth five things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that the heart of Beaſts is ſlowly digeſted,<note place="margin">avi. <hi>2</hi> can. cap. de all.</note> by reaſon that the Heart fleſh is melancholious, which is hardly digeſted, and ſlowly deſcendeth; and as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith: <hi>Is unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom fleſh;</hi> and as <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith: <hi>It nouriſheth little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that the Maw likewiſe is ill of digeſtion, and ſlow of deſcending, by reaſon that it is a ſinewie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and griſtly, wherefore it digeſteth ill, and engendreth ill bloud. Further the Text ſaith that the extream parts of the Maw, as the bottom and brim, are better digeſted, by reaſon that thoſe parts are more fleſhy and fat.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the tongue is good nouriſhment, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, touching the root as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">avi. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>x can. cap. de carne.</note> 
                  <hi>By reaſon that it is fleſhy and eaſie of digeſtion:</hi> and among all other a roſted Pigs tongue the skin ſcraped off, is like Brawn, as Princes Carvers know, A Neates-tongue, by reaſon that it is moyſt, is not very wholeſom.</p>
               <p>But for all this theſe delicate fellows, before they roſt a Neats-tongue, they ſtop it with cloves, whereby the moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is diminiſhed, and the meat is apter to eat.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that the Lights are eaſie of digeſtion, and eaſie to avoid out, and this is by reaſon of their naturall ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: yet their nouriſhment is little, and vnwholeſome for mans nature, becauſe it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>egmatick, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith. And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115892:60"/>here is to be noted, that though the lights of a Tupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fifth,<note place="margin">avi. <hi>2</hi> ca, de pulmone.</note> is that a Hennes brain is beſt, which (as <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> ſayth) <hi>ſtauncheth bleeding at the noſe.</hi> It muſt be eaten ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſalt or Spices, for (of it ſelf) it provoketh one to vomit. And Phiſitians ſay, that Chickens braines augment the memory. The brains of hogges are vnwholeſome for man. But the braine of a Sheep, of a Hare, or of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, may be eaten with ſalt or ſpices. And of braines, we have more largely ſpoken before, at <hi>Nutrit &amp; Impinguat, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Another cauſe is, that ſalt dryeth and ſuppreſſeth the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, drawing them out of the body, and ſo ſhutteth the poors, and conſequently ſtoppeth the entrance of Venome, which is wont to enter by the poors.</p>

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:115892:62"/>
               <p>Firſt, very ſalt meats mar the ſight, for two cauſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that ſalt things dry over, much, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the eyes the inſtruments of ſight: <hi>For the Eyes are of the nature of water,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phi. <hi>1.</hi> de ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu &amp; ſenſato.</note> as the Phyloſopher ſaith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe is, for that meats very ſalt do engender Itch and nipping in manner as is aforeſaid. Of mordicative mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond hurt is, that very ſalt meats diminiſh the ſéed of generation, by reaſon that very ſalt meats do dry very much all the humidities of the body; whereby the ſéed of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is dryed vp, and ſo made leſſe.</p>
               <p>The third hurt is, it engendreth the skabthy reaſon that ſalt engendreth a ſharp by ting humour aduſt, which cauſeth the skab.</p>
               <p>The fourth hurt is, it augmentoth Atch, by reaſon that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth a mordicative itching humour. And of theſe four hurts <hi>Raſis</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Further, it burneth their bloud that take great quantity thereof: it féebleth their ſight, it diminiſheth the ſeed of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and engendreth itch and ſcab.</p>

               <p>Here the Author reciteth the qualities of all ſavorineſſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſayth, that theſe thrée ſavorineſſes or reliſhes, ſalt bitter, and ſharp heat the body that receiveth them,</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſaith that theſe three ſavorineſſes, fart, ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and pontick, cool.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſayth, that theſe three reliſhes, vnctuous, vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and ſweet, are temperate, they make the body neither hotter no colder,</p>
               <p>Further, according to <hi>Avicen</hi> there be eight talages,<note place="margin">avi li. can. tract. <hi>1.</hi> ce <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> or ſo vorineſſes that follow vnſavorineſſes: <hi>And they be ſweet, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſharp, tart, pontick, ſtiptick, and vnctuous:</hi> and to number vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavorineſſe for ſavorineſſe, as the text doth, there be nine: and then ſavorineſſe is taken for every thing judged by taſt.</p>
               <p>And among theſe talages, there be three hot, as ſaith the text, ſalt, bitter, and ſharp: and as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith. <hi>The ſharp is the hotter, and the next ſalt, and then the bitter:</hi> for as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>as ſharp, is ſtronger then the bitter is, to reſolve and ſcour the incidents. And then ſalt is like bitter, broken together with cold humidity,</p>
               <p>And of theſe tallages three be cold, eager, ſtiptick, and pontick. But pontick is colder then the other: and next thereto is ſtiptick. And therefore all fruits that come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſweetneſſe, have firſt a tallage pontick, of a vehement coldneſſe, and after that the fruits, by the heat of the Sun be digeſted, there appeareth in them ſtipticity, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they decline to ſowrneſſe as Grapes, and then to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, And though tart be not ſo hotte as ſtiptick, yet by reaſon that it is ſubtile and piercing, it is in many of more coldneſſe. And after <hi>Avicen, Ponticke and Stipticke are in talage very like, but yet the Stipticke cauſeth the upper
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115892:63"/>part of the Tongue to be ſharp and rough, and pontick cauſeth the tongue to be rough within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three of theſe tallages are temperate, neither exceeding, hot nor cold, as ſweet, vnctuous, and vnſavory, for though ſweet be hot, yet therein appeareth no mighty heat, as <hi>Raſis</hi> ſayth: and every tallage hath his own operations, as <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſay.</p>
               <p>The operations of ſweetneſſe be digeſtion, ſoking and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of nouriſhment, and nature lovingly deſireth it, and the vertue attracttive draweth it.

               <p>The operations of bitter, is to ſharp, and to waſh away. And after <hi>Raſis, Bitter heateth and dryeth ſtrongly, and lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the bloud to a duſt malice, and augmentetha ruddy colour in the bloud.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The operations of ſtiptick talage after <hi>Avicen, Is contrary, thicking, hardning and holding.</hi> And after <hi>Raſis,</hi> the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof are like pontick, though they be weaker: for he ſeemeth to comprehend ſtiptick tallage vnder pontick for of ſtiptick he ſaith nothing expreſſely.</p>

               <p>Here the Authour reciting certain doctrines ſayth:<note place="margin">To keep dyet.</note> That it is good for all folks to keep a cuſtomable dyet. And by dyet is vnderſtood the miniſtring of meat and drinke. The breaking from cuſtomable uſe, hurteth grievouſly: for cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance is another Nature. Therefore as it behooveth vs to keep nature, ſo likewiſe it doth cuſtome: and ſpcially if the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomable uſe be laudable.</p>
               <p>And as it behooveth vs to keep the cuſtomable adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meate and drinke: even ſo it behooveth vs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve cuſtome in other things not naturall, for the ſelf ſame reaſon. Wherefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115892:64"/>will forgo this cuſtome, and live idely, or labour much leſſe, or go in hand with other labour, or take another time, or another way: vndoubtedly it ſhall right much inféeble him. So in like manner it is in mans dyet, in his ſléep, in his watch, and ſuch like accidents. For truly, good cuſtom in all things muſt néeds be obſerved, if it be laudable, or indifferent in goodneſs or hurtfulneſſe, in reſpect of that whereto the change is made.</p>
               <p>And know withall, that they that be accuſtomed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and exerciſe themſelves in any kind of labour: albeit that they be féeble or old, yet it grieveth them leſſe, and they labour more ſtrongly, then if they were young fellows vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Hip. <hi>1</hi> apho.</note> 
                  <hi>By reaſon that theſe feeble or old perſons have more inclination and cuſtom to thoſe labours. For then the cuſtom before taken is lighter,</hi> as is ſaid in the aforeſaid <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the cauſe, why we ſée old and féeble Craftes-men, to do that which ſtronger and younger men then they cannot do, in regard if grieveth them leſſe. As a feeble old Miller, to lift a great weighty ſack: a Smith to wéeld and labour with a great Hammer, then a younger man not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to accuſtomed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Doctrine is: <hi>That great harm followeth chang of Dyet,</hi> as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Hip. <hi>1</hi> apho.</note> 
                  <hi>Except it be needfull to change it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it is néedfull to change it, when grievous diſeaſes ſhould grow thereby: as cuſtom to feed on ill meats, which at length (of neceſſity) will breed in vs old diſeaſes. Such a cuſtom, and other like muſt néeds be amended and changed by little and little, but not ſuddenly. For all ſudden changes hurt vehemently, ſpecially from a thing cuſtomable, to a thing vnaccuſtomable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is needfull to change, to the intent if ſhould leſſe grieve vs, if we happen to change our dyet. For he that vſeth himſelf to all manner of dyet, ſhall hurt himſelf the leſſe. And this muſt be vnderſtood of other things not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115892:65"/>for as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Hip. <hi>1</hi> aph.</note> 
                  <hi>A thing long accuſtomed, though it be worſe then thoſe that we have not uſed, hurteth the body leſſe.</hi> Therefore it behooveth vs to uſe things vnaccuſtomed.</p>
               <p>And here is to be noted, that every man ſhould take heed, how he accuſtometh himſelf to one thing, he it never ſo good, which to obſerve were needfull. For example: If a man cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> himſelf to one manner of meat or drink, or do abſtain wholly from them or to ſleep, or to know a woman carnally: it were very dangerous if he otherwhiles muſt abſtain from his cuſtom. Therefore every body ſhould be diſpoſed, to endure heat and cold, and to all motions and nouriſhments, ſo that the hours of Sleep and Watch the Houſe Bod, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be changed without hurt: which things may be done: if one be not too near in obſeruing cuſtome. <hi>Therefore otherwhiles it behooveth to change cuſtomable things.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Raſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Raſis 3 alea. de conſervan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third Doctrine is, that the ſtronger and nearer way inhealing a Patient, is to miniſter a certain dyet: for which if the Phyſitian doth not care, but will miniſter another vndue dyet: he governeth his patient fooliſhly, and healeth him ill.</p>
               <p>And note, that there be three manner of dyets, groſſe, which is whole folks dyet,<note place="margin">Three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dyets.</note> ſlender dyet, which is to give in manner nothing, and the third is mean dyet, which abſolutely is called ſlender. And this dyet is divided into ſlender dyet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to groſſe dyet as the broth of fleſh, rere roaſted Egs, ſmall Chickens: and declining to ſlender dyet, as <hi>Mellicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> and wine of Ponigranades: and mean dyet, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led certaine dyet, as Barley, juyce, not beaten together. And this certaine dyet is wholeſome in many diſeaſes, but not in all.</p>
               <p>It is not wholeſome in long diſeaſes: for in ſuch diſeaſes, the might of the patient, with ſuch mean dyet, cannot endurs to conſume the ſickneſſe, without great debility. Therefore in ſuch diſeaſes the meat muſt be ingroſſed, Likewiſe it is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115892:65"/>vnwholeſom in ſharp diſeaſes, as thoſe that end within three days ſpace or ſooner: <hi>For in ſuch ſickneſſe, moſt ſlender Dyet is beſt,</hi> as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith. The moſt ſoveraign help, is to dyet the Patient after his ſtrength and corporall might.</p>

               <p>Firſt, of what quality the matter ought to be: for in hote ſickneſſes, he muſt dyet the patient with cold meat in moyſt ſickneſſes with dry meat, and in dry ſickneſſes with moiſt meat Pet the naturall complexion muſt be obſerved with diet like thereunto. For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Gal. in <hi>1</hi> reg.</note> 
                  <hi>The hotter bodies need the hotter medicines: the coldrr bodies, the colder medicines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is of what ſubſtance the meat ought to be. For they that be ſtrong and luſty, and exerciſe great labour muſt be dyeted with groſſer meat becauſe in them the way of digeſtion is ſtrong, and ſo the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ought not to uſe ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der meats, as Chickens, Capons Veal, or Kid, For thoſe fleſhes in them will burn, or be diseſted overſoon: wherefore they muſt needs eat oft.</p>
               <p>But noble men, and ſuch as live reſtfully, moſt vſe dyet of ſlender ſubſtance, for in them the vertue Digeſtive is weok, and not able to digeſt groſſe meats, as Bacon Beefe, and fiſh dryed in the Sunne. Likewiſe, they that be ſick of ſharp diſeaſes, ought to vſe more ſlender dyet, then they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115892:66"/>that be ſick of long diſeaſes, as a Fever-Quartane.</p>
               <p>The third is, what time dyet ought to be given: for they that be in health, ought ſpecially to regard cuſtom, Wherfore they that riſe early in Summer, and eat but two meals a day, ought to eat about the hour of ten, or a little before: and not to abide till noon, becauſe of the over-great beat. Likewiſe, they ought to ſup about the hour of ſix, or a little after. But in Winter, they ought to dine at eleven of the clock, or at twelve, becauſe of the long ſléeping: and then to ſup at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a clock, or a little after, and eſpecially cuſtom ſhould be kept.</p>
               <p>Time alſo (in dyeting of ſick folks) muſt be conſidered: for they that have an Ague, when it beginneth to vex them, or a little before or after they ſhould eat nothing: For if one eat a little before, or when the fit cometh: thereby Nature (that ſhould extend to digeſt the meat) is diverted another way. It be ſhould eat ſoon after the fit is gone, it were vnwholeſome: becauſe the vertue of digeſtion is very weak, by reaſon of the fit paſt, Therefore he muſt eat ſo long before as the meat may be digeſted ere the fit come: Or elſe ſo long after the fit is gone, when as Nature is come to due diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>This is of truth, except ye dread great feebliſhing of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For then at all times he muſt eat. <hi>For whenſoever mans ſtrength is feebled by any chances, he ſhould eat forthwith</hi> as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Gal. in con: Aphoriſmi, contemplari, autem, &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fouthly, the quantity of the meat muſt be conſidered: For, as it is before ſaid, in Summer we muſt vſe a ſmall quantity of meat at every meal, for then the naturall heat is feeble, through the over'great reſolutions. But in Winter, one may eat a great deal of meat at a meal. For then the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue digeſtive is ſtrong, when the naturall heat is vnited through circumſtant cold, as we ſaid at <hi>Temporibus Veris, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth is how off we ſhould eat in a day. For in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we muſt eat oftner then in Winter, in Autumne and Ver, a little at each meal, as is beforeſaid. Likewiſe if the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115892:66"/>vertue digeſtive be weake, we muſt eat little and off: but if the vertue digeſtive be ſtrong, we may eat much, and make few meales, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the eating place muſt be conſidered: which ſhould not be too hot nor too cold, but temperate.</p>

                     <l>Yet if the broth and ſubſtance both you take,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Here the Authour declaring three things, ſayth: That the broth of Cole-worts, and ſpecially the firſt broth, if they be ſodde, loaſeth the belly, by reaſon that in the leaves and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts of the Cole-worts, is a ſopy ſcouring vertue, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleaving, and lightly ſeparable, by ſmall decoction or boy' ling, which being ſpred abroad by the ſame water, is made Laxative. And this is the reaſon that the firſt water, that Coleworts be ſod in, doth make one Laxative, rather then the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that the ſubſtance of Cole-worts after they are boyled, reſtraineth the belly: by reaſon that all their vertue Laxative is taken by the decoction, and the earthy dry ſubſtance remaineth, which bindeth the womb.</p>
               <p>The third is, that both taken together, the broth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Cole-worts, looſeth the belly: by reaſon that the ſcowring ſopy vertue remaineth in the water, which looſeth all.</p>
               <p>And note, that coleworts engender melancholly humours and ill dreames, they hurt the ſtomack, they nouriſh little, and duſk the ſight, and cauſe one to dream, and they provoke menſtruoſity and vrine as <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Raſis</hi> ſay.</p>
               <p>Futhermore note, <hi>That the decoction or ſeed of Cole-worts

For the ſubtile ſuper fluities, that naturally could not deſcend, by reaſon that the heat of the wine ſtirreth them to aſcend vpward to the brain are repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed down, and (by vertue of this juyce) are drawn to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

               <p>Secondly be putteth three effects of Sage.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that ſage comforteth the ſinews: for it drieth the humidities, by which the ſinews be let and looſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that it taketh away the ſhaking of the hand:<note place="margin">The vertue of Sage.</note> by reaſon that it comforteth the ſinews (as is ſaid:) Now all thinges that comfort the ſinews remove trembling: becauſe trembling commeth of féebleneſſe of the ſinewes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſome old men and women, ſpecially put ſage leaves in their meat and drink.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sage letreth the ſharp ague that would aſſail vs by reaſon that it dryeth humors, it letteth them to putrifie, whereby a ſharp Fever might be engendred.</p>
               <p>Further note, that Sage is hot and dry, and therefore it is not very wholſom alone in the way of meat, Yet becauſe Sage comforteth the ſinews greatly, folks in hearth do vſe it much two manner of ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they make Sage-wine,<note place="margin">ſage-wine</note> which they drink eſpecially at the beginning of dinner or ſupper. This wine is wholeſome for them that have the falling ſickneſſe, moderately taken, and after the purgation of the accident matters,</p>
               <p>Secondly, they vſe Sage in ſauces: for it ſtirreth up a mans appetite and ſpecially when the ſtomack is full of ill humors, raw, and vndigeſted,</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of Sage:<note place="margin">Two kinds of ſage.</note> One that hath great broad leaves, and another commonly called Noble Sage, whoſe leaves he more narrow, and leſſe: Phiſitians call it <hi>Sili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fagus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Author reciteth ſixe medicines good for the Palſie. It is ſaid, that ſage, Caſtorie, that is a Caſtor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115892:69"/>And that Caſtorie is wholeſome for the Palſey, appeareth, in that it is moſt comfortable, in heating and drying the ſinews: For <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith thereof: <hi>That is ſubtiler, and ſtronger then any other that heateth and dryeth.</hi>

               <p>Of <hi>Lavender</hi> it appeareth, becauſe the ſweet ſavour thereof doth conſume the Palſie matter.</p>
               <p>And alſo of the <hi>Primroſe</hi> it appeareth: becauſe the ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and heat thereof comforteth the Sinews. This flower is called <hi>Primula Veris,</hi> becauſe it is the firſt flower that ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>Ver.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, touching their operation, Phyſicians agrée not. For ſome ſay they be good for flegmatick folkes, and ſome ſay nay: as <hi>Raſis,</hi> which ſaith: <hi>That they engender ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, onyons be wholſome for phlegmatick folks. For they be hot, piercing, ſubtile, ſcouring and opening, wherefore they digeſt, cut make ſubtile, and wipe away phlegmatick and clammy humours, growne in the bodies of phlegmaticks folks.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Onyons be wholeſome for the ſtomack, for they both heat and mundifie it from phlegm.<note place="margin">avi. can. <hi>2</hi> ca de ireal &amp; <hi>6 4</hi> ca. de curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one alopecie.</note> And therefore <hi>Avicen</hi> faith: <hi>That that which is eaten of the oynon, through the heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, comforceth a weak ſtomack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore they make a man well colored. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for one to have a lively colour, if his ſtomack, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phlegmatick, or ſilled with ill, raw, and phlegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>The fift is, that Onyons ſod and ſtamped, reſtore haires again, if the place where the hairs did grow, be rubbed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. This is of truth when the haires go away through ſtopping of the Pores, and corruption of the matter vnder the ſkinne. For the onyons open the Pores and reſolve the ill matter vnder the skinne, and draw good matter to the ſame place. And therefore as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith: <hi>Oft rubbing with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is very wholeſome for bald men,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the text concludeth, that this rubbing with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, prepareth the beauty of the head: for hairs are the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the head.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, onions ſtirre one to carnall luſt, and they drovoke the appetite, and bring colour in the face, and when they be mingled with hony, they deſtroy Warts they engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thicſt, and they hurt the vnderſtanding: becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender an ill groſſe humour: <hi>They engender ſpittle, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond effect is, it purgeth the brain, and cleanſeth away the phlegmatick humidities of the head. And alſo is it be put into the Noſethrils, it purgeth the head by reaſon that it provoketh one to neeſe. And therefore it is put into their noſthrils that have the Apoplexie, for the neeſing purgeth the brain.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe Muſtard-ſéed, by reaſon that it is hotte, doth diſſolve and looſe ſuch phlegmes, as stop the conduits of the

And for that, all pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is good: for all pepper is a diminiſher and avoider of wind And <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth: <hi>That white pepper and long,<note place="margin">Againſt the belly-ach.</note> is wholeſome for pricking ach of the belly, if it be drunk with hony, and freſh Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Pepper withſtandeth the cauſes of a cold Fever, for it digeſteth and heateth the matter.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Pepper is wholſome for a ſhaking fever, by reaſon that the heat of the Pepper comforteth the ſinews, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the matter ſpread on them.

And beſides theſe effects; <hi>Pepper heateth the ſinews and brains of mans body: it mundifieth the lights, and a little provoketh the vrine, but much looſeth the belly,</hi> as <hi>Avicen.</hi> ſaith:</p>
               <p>There be three ſorts of Pepper: white-Pepper, called <hi>Leucopiper,</hi> long-Pepper, called <hi>Macropiper,</hi> and black-Pepper, called <hi>Melanopiper.</hi> It is called white-pepper that is very gréen and moiſt: and when it is a little dried, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ripe, it is called long-Pepper. But when it is perfectly ripe, it is called black-pepper.</p>

               <p>The firſt is immediate ſleep after meat, and that is, if one eathis fill. For the immediate ſleep will not ſuffer the meat to digeſt, and of meat vndigeſted are engendred groſſe undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted fumes, which with their groſſeneſs ſtoppe the conduites of hearing: and they engroſſe and trouble the ſpirits of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>

               <p>Here the Author reciteth ſeven things, which cauſe a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and a noiſe in ones ear.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, fear, ſpecially after ſome motion. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe in feare, the ſpirits and humours creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward the heart ſuddenly, by which motion, ventoſity is lightly engendred, which entring to the Organ of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, cauſe the tinging and ringing in the ear. By corporall moving alſo humours and ſpirits are moved, of which moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ventoſity is lightly engendred, which coming to the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, cauſeth ringing. For ringing is cauſed through ſome moving of the vapour or ventoſity, about the Organe of the hearing, moving the naturall air of thoſe Pipes or Organes, contrary to their naturall courſe,</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, is great hunger, <hi>Avicen</hi> ſheweth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The third is vomiting: for in vomiting (which is a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motion) humours are ſpecially moved to the head. In to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whereof, we ſee the eyes and face become red, and the ſight hurt. And thus alſo by vomiting vapours and vento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities are ſoon moved to the organ of the hearing.</p>
               <p>The fourth is beating about the head, ſpecially the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115892:78"/>Nature immediately ſendeth thereto wind and bloud, which two be the inſtruments of nature, by which then motion is cauſed in the ear.</p>
               <p>The fift is falling, eſpecially on the head, for the ſame cauſe that is ſhewed of beating. And of a fall (whatſoever it be) a moving of the humours is cauſed in the body.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is drunkenneſſe: for drunkenneſſe filleth the head with fumes and vapors, which approaching to the Organe of the hearing, troubleth it and maketh a noyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſeventh is cold, for by great cold the organe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is feebled, wherefore of a ſmall cauſe by cold, ringing in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ar chanceth, for great cold cauſeth ventoſities.</p>
               <p>And ringing in the ears chanceth not only by theſe cauſes, but alſo of many other, as ventoſitie engendred in the head, and therein moved, or elſe by ſome matter engendred in the head, of elſe by motions of ventoſities, chancing oftentimes in the opening of the ear, as they that have an Ague: or by the great repletion of the body, and moſt eſpecially of the head or by ſome clammy matter reſolved into a little ventoſity, or by medicines, <hi>Whoſe property is, to retain humours and ventoſities in the parts of the brain,</hi> as ſayth <hi>Avicen.</hi>

               <p>The firſt is baining, or bathing whether it he moyſt or dry, called hot-houſes. For baining greatly heateth the eyes, and ſo hurteth the complexion: for the eyes be naturally cold, and of the nature of water.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Baining dryeth and reſolveth the ſubtile humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the eyes, with which the fighty ſpirits that are flerie. ſhould be refreſhed and tempered.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed becauſe abſtinence dryeth, and the matter is better ryped and conſumed: For when nature fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no matter of food whereon ſhe may work, ſhe worketh on Rheumatick matter, and conſumeth it, and the head is leſſe filled ther with. Wherefore <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith: <hi>That a man having the <hi>Catharre</hi> or the Poſe, ſhould take heed that he fill not himſelfe with meats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is Watch for watching dryeth the brain, and withſtandeth that the vapours aſcend not to the head.</p>
               <p>The third is hot meats and brinks; for with their heat, the cold water of the Rheum is digeſted.</p>
               <p>The fourth is to labour much: For thereby the matter Rheumatick is conſumed by reaſon that much labour dryeth vp all ſuperfluityes of the body. But in ſtead of <hi>Valde,</hi> ſome texis have <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115892:81"/>
               <p>The fift is inſpyring of hot ayr, and ſpecially if the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarre</hi> proceed of cold matter: for by breathing of warm ayr, the matter is warmed and riped.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is to drink little, and to endure thirſt: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Rheumatick matter is conſumed: For little drinking filleth not the head, as much as drinking doth.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is to hold ones breath, for that is ſpecially good in a <hi>Catarre,</hi> cauſed of a cold matter: By reaſon that this hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the breath heateth the parts of the breſt, &amp; ſo the cold ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>gmatick matter cauſing the <hi>Catharre,</hi> is better digeſted.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>It behooveth to keep the head warm continually. And alſo it muſt be kept from the wind and namely that of the South. For the South wind repleteth and maketh rare: but the North wind conſtraineth. And he muſt drink no cold water, nor ſleep in the day time. He muſt endure thirſt, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and watch as he can: for theſe things (in this ſickneſſe) are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of health,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore <hi>Raſis</hi> biddeth him that hath the Rheum:<note place="margin">Raſis. <hi>3.</hi> al.</note> 
                  <hi>To beware of lying upright: For by lying upright the Rheumatick matter ſloweth to the hinder parts of man, where be no manifeſt iſſues, whereby the matter may avoyd out.</hi> Therefore it is to be feared, leaſt it flow to the ſinews, and cauſe the cramp or pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe he ought vtterly to forbear wine: for wine is vaporous, and in that it is very hot, it diſſolveth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and augmenteth the Rheum. And likewiſe he muſt not ſtand in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the laſt two verſes, the Author putteth difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe <hi>3.</hi> names, <hi>Catarrus, Branchus</hi> and <hi>Coriſa.</hi> And the difference ſtandeth in the matter flowing to one part or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the body. When the matter runneth to the breſt-parts it is called <hi>Catarrus,</hi> when it tunneth by the noſe, it is called <hi>Coriſa,</hi> when it runneth by the neck, it is called <hi>Branchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this word Rheum doth note and fig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>egme, Choler and Melancholy, as is ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beſt of them is Bloud; Firſt, becauſe it is the matter of mans ſpirits, in whom conſiſteth mans life and operations. Secondly, becauſe it is comfortable to the principles of mans life, it is temperatly hot and moyſt. Thirdly, becauſe it reſtoreth and nouriſheth the body more then the other humors. And it is called the treaſure of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For if it be loſt, Death followeth forthwith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next to bloud in goodneſs, is Flegme. Firſt, by reaſon that if need be, it is apt to be turned into bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly becauſe it is very neer like humidity, which is as the foundation of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After Flegme in goodneſs is Choler, which is partner with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat, ſo long as it keepeth convenient meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then followeth Melancholy, as dregs and dirt removed apart, from the principals of life, as enemy to joy and liberality, and of neer kindred to age and death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly note, that in the diviſion of humors, there are two kinds of bloud (that is to ſay) naturall and vnnaturall. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bloud, that is to ſay, Veyn bloud, which is ruddy and obſcure; and Artery bloud is ruddy and clear, without ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and (in compariſon of other humors) it is very ſweet. Of vnnaturall is two ſorts, the one is vnnaturall in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is to ſay which is changed from good complexion in it ſelf, or elſe by mingling of another humor.</p>
            <p>There is another vnnaturall bloud, which (through min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of other humors) is ill, both in quality and ſubſtance, quantity, and in proportion of the one to the other. And this is double, for the one is not naturall, by mingling of an ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that commeth to him from without, The other is vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, by mingling of an ill humour, engendred in the ſelfe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115892:84"/>blood; as when part of the blood is putrified, and the ſubtile part thereof is turned into Choler, and the groſs part into melancholy: or elſe into Choler or the melancholy or elſe both remaineth in the blood.</p>
            <p>And this vnnatural blood by mingling of an ill humor, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yeth from natural blood many wares,</p>
            <p>Firſt in ſubſtance: for it is groſser and fowler, ſith melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly is mingled there with: or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lſe it is more ſubtile, when watriſhnes or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>trine choler is mingled therewith.</p>
            <p>Secondly in colour: for ſometime when phlegm is mingled therewith, it inclineth to whiteneſs or through melancholy to blackneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly in favor: for by mingling of putrified humors: if is more ſtinking or elſe by mingling of raw humors, it hath no ſavor.</p>
            <p>Fourthly in tallage: for by mingling of Choler it inclineth to bitternes, and by melancholy to ſowernes, or the phlegm of unſavorines.</p>
            <p>Alſo of phlegm there be two kinds, natural and vnnatural Natural is that which (within a certain ſpace) wil be bloud, for phlegm is vndigeſted blood,</p>
            <p>There is another ſpice of phlegm which is ſweet, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what warm, if it be compared to the bodily hear. But compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to the ruddy bloud, and choler, it is cold. Flegm is naturally white: and this is called ſweet phlegm, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this name ſweet to all the talages, delighting the taſte: for otherwiſe the naturall phlegm is not ſweet, but unſavory and wateriſh and very neer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>allage of water. And to this phlegm nature hath not given a proper Manſion, as ſhe hath done to Choler and melancholy: but nature maketh it run with the blood, for it is a very néer ſimilitude to blood,</p>
            <p>And of this phlegm there be two neceſſityes, &amp; one vtility.</p>
            <p>The firſt neceſſity is that it be near the members, ſo that their vertue may digeſt it, and turn it into bloud, and that the members by it may be nouriſhed, when they have loſt their naturall food: (that is for to ſay) good bloud, through
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115892:84"/>reſtraint of material blood, which reſtraint is cauſed through the ſtomack and liver through ſome cauſe accidentall.</p>
            <p>The ſecond neceſſity is, that it mingle with the blood, and make it apt to nouriſh, the memhers of phlematick complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous as the brain and ſuch: for that which muſt nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſh theſe members muſt be mingled with phlegm.</p>
            <p>The vtility of phlegm is, that it moyſten the joynts, and members that move much, leaſt they ware <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry through the heat that cometh of their moving and rubbing.</p>
            <p>Vnnatural phlegm may be divided firſt into the ſubſtance, and to ſome thereof is <hi>Muſcilaginoſum,</hi> and that is phlegm, (to ones ſeeming) divers for in ſome part it is ſubtile &amp; thin, and in ſome other groſs and thick: is called <hi>Muſcilaginoſum,</hi> becauſe it is like Muſcilages, drawn out of ſeede.</p>
            <p>There is an other phlegm, that appeareth equall in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: that is in ſubtility and groſſeneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> deeming, but for a truth it is divers in every place this is named raw phlegm, and this, increaſeth in the ſtomack, and entrailes. And to avoid it out of the ſtomack. <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> biddeth us, <hi>To caſt twice a moneth, and to avoid it out of the guts: Nature hath ordained Choler to turn it from the cheſt of the Gal to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trail <hi>Iejunium,</hi> and ſo ſorth to the lower guts, to ſcowr away the phlegm from the brims of the entrails, and cauſe it to deſcend down with the other dregs and filth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the flegm is increaſed in the vein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of old folkes, by diminiſhing of their digeſtion, and there remaining, is by little and little augmented and engroſſed, and hurteth nature, which cannot (by the veins thereto ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) avoid it out. Yet it doth all that is poſſible, to keep it from the hearts, and other inward m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbers, and driveth it to the outward members, and ſpecially to the Legs: for by the heavineſſe thereof it draweth naturally to the lower parts of man. And this is the cauſe why old folkes legs are ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lne, and that if one preſs downe his finger therein, there tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115892:85"/>a hole, ſpecially towards night, moſt in fat folks and ſuch, as were wont to be nouriſhed with moiſt meat.</p>
            <p>There is another ſpice of phlegm, very ſubtile and watriſh like vnto water, and ſomewhat thick: this phlegm is often mingled with their ſpittle that have ill digeſtion, and of thoſe that be great drinkers: it removeth from the brain to the noſe, as it is wont in the beginning of the poſe, and when by decoction and boyling in a man it becommeth groſſe, it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into phlegm groſſe, white and muſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lage.</p>
            <p>There is another phlegm groſſe and white called <hi>Gipſeum</hi> the ſubtile parts of this phlegme, is diſſolved through long biding in the joints: and the groſſenes thereof remaineth in the joynts as hard as ſtones. This phlegme engendreth the Gowt vncurable.</p>
            <p>There is another phlegm thick and groſſe, like to the mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en glaſſe, in colrr, clammines, and weight.</p>
            <p>Secondly, vnnaturall phlegm differeth in Tailage: for there is certain phlegm that is ſweet, which is by mingling of blood with phlegm. And vnder this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained the vnctuous flegm, which is inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred by mingling vnctuous blood &amp; flegm.</p>
            <p>There is another manner of vnſavory phlegm, cauſed of rawneſſe as certainly glaſſy phlegm.</p>
            <p>There is another ſalt phlegm cauſed by mingling of choler And this is more biting drier, and lighter then any other flegm through the choler mingled therewith, which is dry, light, and ſharp. And this phlegm is often found in their ſtomacks, that be phlematick, that drink much ſtrong wine, and that vſe ſalt and ſharp meats; becauſe it cleaveth to the ſtomack, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth other while thirſt intollerable and running by the guts, if it ſometime fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth them and cauſeth the blood men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n: and in the fundament oftentimes induceth ſtrong coſtiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>There is another phlegm, that is ſharp, by mingling, of ſharp melancholy therewith: and ſometime through boyling of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gine, as it chanceth in the ſwéet juyces of fruits, that firſt boyl and after, wax ripe. And this phlegm appeareth oftner in their ſtomacks that digeſt ill, then in other parts: for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Choler floweth to the mouth of the ſtomack, to ſtirre
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115892:85"/>vp the appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ite, which deſconding downward ſometime min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with flegm, maketh it ſowre and this is perceived by ſowre belchings. And otherwhiles this phlegm is engendred in the ſtomack by boyling with a weak heat.</p>
            <p>There is another phlegm called Pantick, which is ſometime cauſed by mingling of pontick melancholy. But this is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, by reaſon that pontick melancholy, ſo very ſcarce. It is ſometime cauſed through vehement coldneſſe thereof, whereby the moiſtnes thereof is congeled, &amp; ſomwhat altered to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and thereupon commeth no weak heat, which cauſing it to boyl, ſhould convert it into ſharpnes: nor no ſtrong heat, which digeſting it ſhould turn it into blood.</p>
            <p>There be two kinds of Choler, naturall and vnnaturall.</p>
            <p>Vnnaturall Choler is the ſome of bloud, whoſe color is ruddy and clear, that is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trine, in the laſt degree of citrines as Saff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on heads, and it is light and ſharp: and the hotter, the more redder it is. And after this Choler engendred in the head it goeth wite the bloud into the veins the other goeth into the purſe of the gall.</p>
            <p>The part that goeth with the blood endureth therewith both for neceſſity and prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. It is needfull that it mingle with the bloud, to nouriſh the cholerick members It is behooveful that it make the blood ſubtile and cauſe it to enter into the veins.</p>
            <p>The part that goeth to the purſe of the gall, goeth thither for neceſſity and profit. The neceſſity is double. The one is néedful for all the body, to mundifie it from cholerick ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities. The other neceſſity is in reſpect of the gals p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>The preſt alſo is double. The one is, to waſh the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drails from dregs and clammy phlegm cleading to them.</p>
            <p>The other is to waſh the guis and Muſcles that they may féele, the thing that hurteth them, and voyd all other filthines The proof of this is that the cholick chanceth often times, by ſtopping of the hole that commeth from the purſe of the gall to the guts.</p>
            <p>Vnnatural choler is double. For one is vnnatural through outward cauſe mingled therewith. The other is vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115892:86"/>through a cauſe in it ſelf, for the ſubſtance thereof is not naturall.</p>
            <p>Choler vnnaturall through an outward cauſe, is another known and fame as: and is is that, that phlegm is mingled with, and it is called famous or notable by reaſon that it is often engendred. And of this kind of Choler commeth the third, that is wel known. There is another that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>leſſe famous, and that is it wherewith melancholy is mingled.</p>
            <p>Famous Choler is either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me, and engendred by min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of ſubtile phlegm with naturall choler, or elſe it is yol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, like to the yolks of egs, and is engendred by mingling of groſs phlegm with a naturall choler.</p>
            <p>Choler of leſſe ſame is cauſed two ways. One is, when the choler is burned in it ſelf and turned to aſhes, from which the ſubtile part of the Choler is not ſeparated, but mingled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and this choler is the worſt. Another is, when melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly commeth from without, and mingleth it with the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And this Choler is better then other, &amp; is ruddy in color, it is not clear nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lowing but more like to vein-bloud. This vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural choler having his own proper ſubſtance without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of any other humor, is often engendred in the liver, by reaſon that the ſubtilenes of the blood burneth it ſelf &amp; turneth into choler, and groſſely into melancholy.</p>
            <p>Another choler is engendred in the ſtomack of ill meats not digeſted but corrupted: or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is it is engendred in the veins, by other humors. And of this choler be two kinds: for one is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Choler Praſlive,</hi> like the color of the bearb called <hi>Praſlion,</hi> which is engendred of the yolkines when it is burned: for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cauſeth a yolky blackneſſe in the choler, which mingled with choler citrine, engendreth a green cholet.</p>
            <p>The other is called ruſty choler, like to ruſty Iron, and it is engendred of <hi>Praſſive,</hi> when <hi>Praſlive</hi> is burned only, til the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity thereof be dryed away: and of the drineſſe beginneth to war white. And theſe two laſt Cholers be ill, and venemous, yet ruſty, is the worſt.</p>
            <pb n="167" facs="tcp:115892:86"/>
            <p>Likewiſe there be two kinds of melancholy, naturall and unnaturall.</p>
            <p>The naturall is, the dregs and ſuperfluity of good blood, whoſe tallage is between ſweet and pontick. And thus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy when it is engendred in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Vnnaturall melancholly is a thing burned, or aſhes in reſpect of other humors. Of this there are four famous kinds, though there be many not famous.</p>
            <p>The firſt is aſhes of Choler.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is aſhes of flegm, &amp; if the phlegm that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wer very ſubtile and watriſh, then the melancholy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of engendred, will be ſalt in tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The third is aſhes of bloud, and this melancholp is ſalt, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The fourth is aſhes of naturall melancholy. And if naturall melancholly (whereof ſoever it be) be ſubtile, then it will be very ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt phlegmatick folks be weak, by reaſon that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, which is the beginner of ſtrength, and operation, is but feeble.</p>
            <p>Secondly, phlegmatick folks be ſhort and thick: for their naturall heat is not ſtrong enough to lengthen the body, and therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it is thick and ſhort.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, phlegmatick folks are more inclined to idlenes and ſtudy, then folks of other complexion, by reaſon of their coldnes that maketh them ſleepy.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they ſleep longer by reaſon of their great coldneſſe, that provoketh them to ſléep.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, they be dull of wit and vnderſtanding: for as tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat is cauſe of good wit and vnderſtanding, ſo cold is cauſe of blunt wit and dull vnderſtanding.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Here the Author ſpeaking of bloud-letting, ſayth, That
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115892:92"/>at ſeventeen years of age one may be let bloud.</p>
            <p>And touching this, <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal de ingenis</note> 
               <hi>That Children ſhould not be let bloud, before they be 14 year old at leaſt, becauſe Childrens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be ſoon reſolved from outward heat, and therefore by voiding of bloud they ſhould be greatly weakned. Alſo, for that they need to nouriſh their bodies and augment them, they ſhould not diminiſh their bloud. And alſo, for that they be ſoon diſſolved from outward heat, it ſuſhceth that they need not be let bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Know likewiſe, <hi>That as bloud-letting is not convenient for Children, ſo it is unwholeſome for old Folks,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>9</hi> reg!</note> 
               <hi>For the good bloud is little, and the ill much. And bloud-letting draweth away the good bloud, and leaveth the ill,</hi> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Av.</hi> 4.10. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> and therefore bloud-letting is vnconvenient for ſuch perſons. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly be putteth the hurt of bloud-letting, of neceſſity with voyding of bloud, done by bloud-letting, mans ſpirits being in the bloud, do then avoid.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſheweth how the ſpirits ſhould be cheriſhed and reſtored, and that is by drinking of Wine after the bloud, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: For of all things to nouriſh quickly, Wine is beſt, as is before ſaid: The Spirits alſo be cheriſhed and reſtored by meats, but that is not ſo quickly as by Wine. And the meat after bload-letting muſt be light of digeſtion, and a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genderer of bloud, as rere-roſted Egges, and ſuch like. And although meat reſtore tha ſpirits after bloud-letting, yet let the Patients beware of much meat the firſt and ſecond day.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaith <hi>In dictis. That they muſt drink more then they eat, and yet they muſt drink leſſe then they do before bloud-letting, for digeſtion is weaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Author putteth eleven profits of bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when it is duly done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, temperate bloud-letting comforteth the ſight: For
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115892:93"/>diminiſhing of humors doth alſo diminiſh fuming to the head, and the repletion thereof, that darketh the ſight.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it cleareth and maketh pure the mind and brain, through the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it heateth the marrow: for it mingleth the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities that thereto come, and cool it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it purgeth the entrails: for Nature (vncharged of bloud) digeſteth better the raw humors that be left.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, bloud letting reſtraineth vomiting and the lask, for it diverteth the humors from the interior parts to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpecially the letting bloud of the arms, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, for letting bloud of the féet ſtoppeth not ſo well.</p>
            <p>Yet perchance the Bloud-letting ſhall augment the lask. end that two ways. Firſt, by Bloud-letting. Nature is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of her burden, and being comforted, it provoketh other hacuations. Secondly if the Lask be cauſed by great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of vertue contentive: for then, by reaſon that by Bloud-letting vertue is weakned the lask is augmented.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Bloud-letting cleareth the wits: for it miniſheth vaporation that goeth to the head, and troubleth the wits.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, it helpeth one to ſleep, for thereby many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors be voyded, of which divers ſharp vapors are lifted up, that let one to ſleep.</p>
            <p>The eight is, it taketh away tediouſneſſe and over-great grief, for thereby vertue is vnladen of grief: for with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy bloud, the dreas of bloud (which induce tediouſneſs and grief) are drawn out.</p>
            <p>The ninth is, it comforteth the hearing: for thereby the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and humors that aſcend is the head, and let the hearing, are diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>The tenth is, it comforteth the doyce: for thereby the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities and humidities that would come to the Breaſt, or pipe of the Eights, and let the doyce are diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>The eleventh is, it angmenteth the ſtrength, for thereby the body is diſcharged of grief, wherefore the vertue is ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>

                  <l>Three ſpeciall Moneths, our text doth here remember,</l>
                  <l>For letting-bloud, Aprill May, and September,</l>
                  <l>The Moon rules moſt theſe Moneths, yet certain days,</l>
                  <l>Some do deny and other ſome diſpraiſe</l>
                  <l>The firſt of May, and the laſt of Aprill,</l>
                  <l>As alſo of September they hold ill.</l>
                  <l>Days of theſe Moneths they do forbid to bleed,</l>
                  <l>And think it dangerous on a Gooſe to feed.</l>
                  <l>But this is idle, for theſe Moneths are good.</l>
                  <l>And for our health in theſe to let our bloud.</l>
                  <l>For old or young if bloud abounding be,</l>
                  <l>All Moneths it may be done adviſedly.</l>
                  <l>If length of days and health you do deſire,</l>
                  <l>Theſe are the Moneths that bleeding beſt require.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Here the Author ſaith, that theſe thrée, <hi>May, September,</hi> and <hi>Aprill</hi> are the moneths of the Moon, and in them are days for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to let bloud: that is, the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and the laſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> Though this be a common rule, yet it is falſe. For the foreſaid days may be as good, and as worthy to be choſen as the other, after the diverſity of the Couſtellation in them. Farther he ſaith that in thoſe days one ſhould not eate fleſh, which is alſo falſe and erroueous and very withchcraft. I think the Author had this ſaying of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which obſerve ſuch manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſaith. That men of middle Age, and young ſolkes, whoſe Veyns be full of bloud, may be let bloud every

            <p>Thirdly, he ſaith, that bloud-letting for mans health muſt be done in one of theſe three moneths, <hi>May, September,</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> But yet with difference, for in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> the Liver-veyn muſt be let bloud, becauſe then in Spring the bloud encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: And in <hi>September</hi> in the ſplene-veyn, becauſe of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which then in Autumn encreaſeth.</p>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Here the Author ſetteth dawn twelve things that do hinder bloud, letting.</p>
            <p>The firſt is coldneſſe of complexion: For, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bloud letting cooleth, and augmenteth coldneſſe.</hi> Becauſe as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaith, <hi>bloud is the foundation of naturall heat: and in regard that bloud-letting voydeth the bloud, it voydeth heat, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cooleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is a fervent cold Countrey, vnder which a cold ſeaſon ſhould be comprehended, which alſo letteth bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115892:94"/>for in a Country and Seaſon very cold, the bloud is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the deepeſt parts of the body, and the bloud that carrieth in the vpper parts, the cold maketh thick which to avoid is no wiſdome.</p>
            <p>The third is fervent ach vnder which alſo may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended great inclamation of the body; for if one in ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents be let bloud, there followeth great motion agitative contrary to nature, and greater inflamation, which weakneth nature more.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this motion agitative is attraction to divers parts: for by bloud-letting) attraction is cauſed to the place that is let bloud: and by great ach, attraction is cauſe to the place of ach.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of greater inflamation is, that by bloud-letting the humors be moved, whereby they be the more inflamed. And this is truth when blou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-letting is little and artificiall: yet if it be done till one ſwound, it is wholeſome in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid caſes: For this bloud-letting when it overcommeth the attraction of the ach it cauſeth not motion agitative and like. wiſe it taketh away inflamation when there be no humours, that ſhould move heat, and cauſe more inflamation. This is <hi>Galens</hi> mind, ſaying;<note place="margin">Gal. comments illius apli. qua geruntur.</note> 
               <hi>There is no no better medicine for an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume of fervent inflammation, Fevers, and a great Ach, than bloud-letting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is bayning, ſpecially reſolutive, for that denyeth Bloud-letting, becauſe that were vacuation vpon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, which Nature cannot eaſily bear.</p>
            <p>The fifth is carnall copulation: for immediatly after that, one ſhould not be letten bloud, becauſe of double weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Nature.</p>
            <p>The ſixth is, too old or too young, as it is before touched. Of this <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth, <hi>Take heed how thou letteſt one bloud in any of the foreſaid caſes, except thou truſt in the figure inſolidite of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, largneſſe of the veyns, the fulneſſe of them, and ruddy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:115892:95"/>
            <p>The ſeventh is long ſickneſſe: for by ſuch letting of bloud Nature is doubly feebled, both by long ſickneſſe and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. <hi>This is truth,</hi> ſayth <hi>Avicen, except there be corrupt bloud, for then bloud-letting is wholeſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eight is great repletion of drink.</p>
            <p>The ninth is to eat too much meat: and vnder this is compriſed meat vndigeſted. The cauſe whereof (as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth) is this. <hi>There be three things that draw to them, that is, emptineſſe, heat and ſecret vertue or property. Then if the veyns be empty through voyding of bloud, they draw to them from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack or liver undigeſted or ſuperſluous meat or drink, which undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted meat when it commeth to the members, cannot be amended, that is digeſted: for the third digeſtion cannot amend the fault of the ſecond, nor the ſecond of the firſt, if the fault be ſo great that it cannot convert into the members, and it there remaining may cauſe ſome diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth is feebleneſſe for bloud-letting is a ſtrong voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith; therefore a feeble perſon may not endure great diminiſhing of bloud.</p>
            <p>The eleventh is ſubtile ſenſiblenes of the ſtomacks mouth, which is called the heart-ſtring, for of ſuch bloud letting ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning followeth lightly. And vnder this weskneſſe of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is compriſed an eaſte flowing of choler to the mouth thereof inducing vomiting, wherefore they that have the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid accidents, ſhould not be let bloud: for by bloud-letting, the humors moved, be endured to the ſtomacks mouth, as to a place accuſtomed: And becauſe it is a weak and an impotent member to reſiſt that flixe; therefore by ſuch letting of bloud, many inconveniences chance.</p>
            <p>This is one cauſe, why ſo many ſound when they he let bloud by reaſon that Choler floweth to the ſtomack, which biting the ſtomack, paineth the heart and ſtomack ſo, that it cauſeth one to ſound.</p>
            <p>The twelfth is loathing: for if in this loathing one be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115892:95"/>let bloud, when the veyns be empty, they draw to them ill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that cauſeth loathſomneſſe.</p>
            <p>And beſides the foreſaid accidents th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> be yet other that hinder bloud-letting.</p>
            <p>Firſt, voyding of menſtruous ſtire, or the Emrauts, for one diſeaſed with either of theſe, ſhould not be let bloud: yet it may be done to divert the flix or matter another tray.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is rareneſſe of compoſition: for in rare bodies is much diſſolution; <hi>And therefore this diſſolution ſufficeth them without evacuation,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>9.</hi> Res.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third is rawneſſe and clammineſſe of humours, for then beware of leting of bloud becauſe it encreaſeth rawnes of humors: &amp; therefore in long ſickneſſe ye ſhould not be let bloud for of rawneſſe, humors encreaſe, ſtrength ſéebleth, and the ſickneſſe prolongeth.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in long ſickneſſe, before one is let bloud, he ſhould take a laxative, although he need both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rawneſſe of humors is cauſed two ways. One is through aboundance of humors that choke natural heat, which choking breedeth raw humors and then bloud-letting is wholeſome.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaith, <hi>Letting of bloud in the beginning of dropſie is wholeſome,<note place="margin">Alex, <hi>2.</hi> l. cap. hydropic.</note> when it commeth by aboundance of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous bloud, that through ſome cauſe is prohibited to iſſue, or by aboundance of the Enmauds For like as a little fire is quenched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great heap of wood, ſo likewiſe naturall heat is ſuffocated with aboundance of humours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe of raw humors, is féebleneſſe of naturall heat, as in folks of feeble complexion, or ſuch as have him long ſick, or be very aged; for then the ſaid bloud-letting is vnwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, becauſe it augmenteth rawneſſe: for the bloud that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth heat is drawn out and ſo the body is made cold, and the humors more raw. Therefore the bloud muſt be left to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt raw humors.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:115892:96"/>
            <p>The fourth is, vndue diſpoſition of the ayr, either too hote or too cold; for much heat cauſeth ſtrong reſolution: and great cold maketh the bloud thick, and vnapt to iſſue or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd.</p>

            <p>The firſt is annointing, which otherwhile is vſed in the Bloud-letting, as to annoint the place or veyn that is opened, to aſſwage the veyn: Sometime it is vſed after Bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to keep the gaſh that it cloſe not vp too ſoon, that the humors that be leſt in the veyns, may have ſome reſpiration and ſome ill fumes voyd out.</p>

            <p>The third is bayning, which is wholeſome thrée days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115892:96"/>and thrée days after, and not the ſame day. It is good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if one think he have groſſe humors within him: for bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning looſeth and moveth the humors, and for the ſame cauſe it is wholeſome to take a ſharp ſtrupe before, to move, diſſolve and make ſubtile the humors.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when ye will let one bloud, ye muſt rub the arm, that the humors in the veyn be made ſubtile and prepared to iſſue out more eaſtly. It is wholeſome after bloud-letting, that the reſidue of humors and vayors that be left behind, may be looſed. It is not wholeſome the ſame day, for bayning maketh the skin linnow or ſupple, which made linnow, will not abide the ſtroke that is given in bloud-letting, and that is dangerous.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, binding with linnen cloaths, which is very wholeſome, to ſtop the bloud after often evacuation thereof, and before bleeding to draw the humors in the veyns, and to cauſe them to ſwell and better to appear.</p>
            <p>The fift is, moderate walking after bloud-letting, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and make ſubtile the humors, and afterward to looſe the reſidue of the humors that be left behind.</p>
            <p>Some vſe to let bloud faſting vut ſome other ſay, it were better to eat a rere rafted Egge firſt, and thereto drinke a draught of wine, about the hour of nine or ten before dinner, and forthwith to let bloud becauſe when the ſtomack is empty nature retaineth ſtill the bloud more ſtrongly, leſt ſhe ſhould lack nouriſhment. But when they have eat a little nouriſhing meat, as wine and egges is, then nature ſuffereth the bloud better to iſſue.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it pleaſeth angry folks: and the reaſon is this, becauſe much melancholy mingled with blood, cauſeth heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and much choler cauſeth anger: which two humors as they be mingled with blood, are drawn our by blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the blood, from the head: and avoideth is by other exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there be five cauſe of blood-letting.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that the aboundance, whether it be in quality or quantity, or both, ſhould be voided. For as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth; <hi>Two manner of folks muſt be let blood. One are ſuch as be diſpoſed to be ſick, that have aboundance of bloud in quantity. The other are they that are ſick already, through the malice of humours or blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a difference in theſe bloud-lettings <hi>For bloud-letting for the aboundance of bloud, ought to be much; but when it is done to avoid ill bloud, it muſt be moderate,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, And therefore they do very ill, that let themſelves blood till they perceive the good blood iſſue: for (peradventure all their blood ſhall run out, ere they ſee any good bloud appear. Therefore they ſhould void a little at once: and after the mind of <hi>Galen</hi> in this caſe <hi>Before they let one bloud, they ſhould give him good meats to engerder good blood, to fulfill the place of the ill blood, that is avoided,</hi> and after (within a little ſpace) <hi>to let bloud a little, and a little.</hi> This is called direct letting of bloud, for it is done to avoid aboundance of bloud, and of ſuch humors as ſhould be avoided.</p>
            <p>The firſt indirect cauſe, is the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe, and greatneſſe of the apparent vehement inflamation; for as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaith. <hi>There is no better Medicine for an Impoſtume of vehement inflamation, Fevers, and a great ach, then bloud-letting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond indirect cauſe is, that the matter which is to bee avoided, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> drawne unto the place from whence it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115892:97"/>muſt be avoided. And therefore in retention of the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flix &amp; Emetauds: <hi>The great vein in the feet called <hi>Saphena,</hi> muſt be opened,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, <hi>to draw down the matter of the bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third indirect cauſe, is to draw the humours to the place, contrary to the place that they flow to, to divert them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the place. Therefore, for too much aboundance of menſtruoſity, the vein <hi>Baſilica</hi> muſt bee let blood, to turns the matter to the contrary part, and ſo to void it from the proper courſe. And therefore, he that hath a Plureſie on his left ſide, muſt be let bloud on the right ſide, to divert and draw the matter to the place, contrary to that place, that it enclineth ſo. And likewiſe if it be on the right ſide, to let blood on the left.</p>
            <p>The fourth indirect cauſe is, that by letting of blood, one portion of the matter may be avoided, that nature may be ſtrong upon the reſidue, and ſo letting of blood is wholeſome when the body is full leaſt impoſtumes grow: for the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature is feeble, in regard of theſe humours. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a portion of matter is voided, nature governeth the matter ſo, that it ſhould not flow to ſome weak place, and breed an Impoſtume.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115892:98"/>the pure blood only goeth out, and the groſs abideth ſtil in. And note that ſometime the gaſh muſt be great, and ſometime ſmal The gaſh muſt be great for thrée cauſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the humors be groſs, and groſs blood muſt be voided, as in them that be melancholly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in winter the gaſh muſt be great, for cold engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the humors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the aboundance of humors, for they avoid bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a great gaſh then by a ſmal. But the gaſh muſt be ſmal when the perſon is of weak ſtrength, that the ſpirits and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat avoid not too much: and likewiſe in a hot ſeaſon, and when the blood is pute.</p>

For <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115892:98"/>breed in the body, or in a member that is hurt: the humors will flow thereunto.</hi> But <hi>Avicen</hi> aſſigneth another cauſe; <hi>That by ſuch ſleep may chance confraction of the members,</hi> The cauſe may be as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. <hi>That ſleep is unwholeſome in the Ague-fit:</hi>

            <p>Firſt, the letting of bleod ſhould be done in the beginning of ſharp diſeaſes, which are ended the fourth day. For ſuch be ſhort, and make no delay: therefore they muſt be remedied at the beginning.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that from <hi>30</hi> year to <hi>45</hi> or <hi>50.</hi> one ſhould be let bloud moſt, for at that age Bloud encreaſeth moſt of all: nor the diminiſhing thereof letteth not the growing, nor the bodily ſtrength is not leſſened therevy, becauſe the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in that age groweth not, but ſeemeth to ſtand ſtill at one ſtate.</p>
            <p>The third is, that old folke and children ſhould be let bloud but little: for young children need moſt bleed to nouriſh and encreaſe them and aged folks ſtrength decayeth from them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in Spring-time double quantity of Blood ſhould be boyded, in regard of other ſeaſons: for that time ſpecially enereaſeth bloud, as all Phyſitians ſay.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt ſaying, a few rules concerning letting of blood would be given.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that at the beginning of the ſickneſſe, one ſhould not be let bloud: for as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Nature is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115892:100"/>of all things, and the Phyſician is Miniſter.</hi> But he ſaith, <hi>That no vacuation at the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ning of ſickneſs,<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>3.</hi> reg. Idem <hi>3</hi> Ape. in conſu agritu dini. Ga, in pho. Inchoanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus morbi.</note> is naturall: for as Nature in the beginning of ſickneſs avoideth nothing, likewiſe no more ſhould the Phyſitian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet three things withſtand this Rule.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, furlo fity or ſterceneſs of the matter. For <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That when the ſickneſs beginneth, one ſhould not be let bloud, becauſe letting of bloud ſhrreth the humours, and maketh them ſubtile, and to run throughout all the body,</hi> except the matter be furious.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is aboundance of the matter: for <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it is then behovefull to be let bloud: or take a Medicine laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to alleviate Nature loaded with aboundance of matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, greatneſſe and ſharpneſs of the ſickneſs, as when there is a great and an achfull impoſiume, though the matter be little. For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the Impoſtume be great, ye muſt be let bloud at the beginning, though there be but little matter, leaſt it break, or open before it be ripe:</hi> therefore to eſchew many inconveniences, bloud-letting muſt be done.</p>
            <p>The ſecond rule is, that bloud-letting may not be done on the day of motion of the ſicknes,<note place="margin">eriſts is a ſudden indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either to hea'th or deaths mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as in <hi>Criſis,</hi> nor no other vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, nor diverting of matter from the place that nature ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it to &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor likewiſe in the Ague fit.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That when the ſickneſs is in his eſtate, neither bloud-letting, nor laxative ſhould be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For then the matter ripeth, which ripeth better by quietneſſe then by ſtirring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third rule is, that bloud-letting ſhould not be done in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſicknes, when <hi>Criſis</hi> is removed.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaith, in his Book of Vrines. <hi>That though the Heart be the Engenderer of the bloud and ſpirits, yet the bloud is foundation of Natural heat, and ſuſtaineth it, for the heat is naturally thereof engendred.</hi> And therefore, be that voydeth Bloud, voideth heat, which ſhould digeſt the matter of the ſickneſs,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115892:100"/>and ſo conſequently the ſickneſſe is prolonged; and ſtrength weakned. And therefore it is to be feared, leaſt through the lengthning of the ſickness, and weakning of the ſtrength, nature would ſail.</p>
            <p>The fourth rule is that the body (having dregs of filth in the guts) ſhould not be let blood. The cauſe is, there be thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things that draw to them heat emptines, and all things ſharp: ſo when as the veins be emptied by Letting of blood, they draw to them from the next member, as the guts and ſtomack, whereby the belly is judurated, and the matter in the Veins is more infected the <hi>Meſeraike</hi> drawsth the humidities of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures and the ordures are dried the more, therefore you muſt firſt mollifie the belly with Cliſters or Suppoſitorie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, except it war laxative alone.</p>
            <p>The fift rule is, that letting of blood ſhould not be much vſed; for by oft vſing thereof, one drawing on in age, falleth into divers diſeaſes, as <hi>Epilepſie, Apoplexie,</hi> and <hi>Palſey,</hi> for by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the blood and heat, many phlgematick ſuper flutties are engendred that cauſe theſe diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The ſixt rule is, that a woman menſtruate, or with child, ſhould not be let blood. A Woman with Child ſhould not: for thereby the heat, that digeſteth meat, is diminiſhed, and the food of that ſhe goeth with is taken away ſpecially when if that ſhe goeth with waxeth great: for then it needeth more food. Thus ſaith <hi>Hypocrates: <hi>When the menſtruoſity keepeth due courſe, and avoidoth naturally enough, letting of blood ſhould not be done: but when it avoydeth too much, then (to divert the matter) it muſt be done, for nature would not be let of her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh rule is that after the Chollicke paſſion, one ſhould not be let blood, for by reaſon that Letting of blood ſtirreth vp the humors: a Cholerick humor may flowe to the ſtomack, and enflame it: Nor after vomiting, leaſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors likewiſe flow to the ſtomack: Nor after the Flixe, nor after great watching: nor after much travell: nor after any thing that greatly hurteth or diſſolveth: for in theſe two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115892:101"/>letting of blood ſhould greatly move the humors, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>féeble the ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Now it is to be conſidered, who are meet to be let bloud: and therefore we ſhall declare a few rules.</p>
            <p>The firſt rule is, that letting of blood is very expedient for delicate idle, and corſte folks, and that vſe meats engendring much blood.</p>
            <p>The ſecond rule is, it is wholeſome for thoſe that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of bloud, which aboundance is known by the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the brine: for aboundance of bloud maketh it thick, and aboundance of Choler maketh it thin.</p>
            <p>The third is they ſhould be let bloud, in whom melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly aboundeth: For when much naturall Melancholy run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the bloud throughout all the body not puriſting the ill bloud: then letting of blood is wholeſome.</p>
            <p>There be two kinds of melancholymatural, and vunafural,</p>
            <p>Naturall is the dregs of bloud which when it aboundeth, it runneth with blood, and in letting of bloud is votded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For, of the ſame temperate beat, blood and melancholy, the dregs thereof is engendred.</p>
            <p>The fourth rule is, that when boyling conturbation, and calefactions of humors is feared, it is wholeſome to let blood: and thoſe perſons, as ſoon as they feel themſelves inflamed, ſhould be let blood, to avoid the foreſaid motions, cauſed by the great aboundance of humors.</p>
            <p>Yet otherwhiles ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e deceived by this rule, for forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with when they feel calefaction, and fear boyling of humors, they let them blood. And when this commeth of beat calefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inciſion, the calefaction or boyling ceaſeth not by Blood. letting, but it is rather augmented: for bloud-letting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the humors, and maketh them run thorough the body. Therefore letting of Blood is not wholeſome, except it be for aboundance of humors, which is known by much ſweat, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the morning, for there be ſome that ſweat not except they need evacuation.</p>
            <p>The fift this is, they that be mighty and ſtrong ſhould be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115892:101"/>let bloud and not they that be cold and dry. For <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith: <hi>That thoſe bodies are apt to be let bloud, which have great apparent veins that be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here the Author reciting certain things, concerning the members that be let bloud, ſaith:</p>
            <p>That in War and Summer, the veyns of the right hand, arm, or foot ſhould be let bloud: But in winter and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, the veyns of the left hand, arm or foot muſt be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>The cauſe hereof may be, for that Her encreaſeth Blood, and Summer Choler, therfore in Uer and Summer vs ſhould diminiſh thoſe veins in which bloud &amp; Choler abound, which be on the right ſide of the body, near to the member that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth good bloud (that is the Liver) and the receptacle of choler, the Gall.</p>
            <p>Autumne engendreth Melancholy, which is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and not reſolved by Winter: therefore in War and Winter, theſe two Ueyns ſhould be let-bloud, in

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Here the Author reciteth five commodityes that come by letting of blood of the vein <hi>Saluatella.</hi> It is the vein on the back of the hand, between the midle ſinger, and the King-ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it purgeth the lyder, it cleanſeth the Splene, it mundifieth the brett, is pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſerveth the ſtomacks mouth from hurt, it doth away the hurt of the voice. The reaſon of all theſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes is becauſe the foreſaid vein avoideth blood from all theſe places, as after it ſhall appeat.</p>
            <p>For a more ample declaration, you are to underſtand, that in letting of blood, other whiles the veynes be opened, and ſometime the Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>One is through fervent heat of the Artery blood, for a hot thing is ſoon moveable, and dilateth and openeth the Artery, and therefore t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h much to void the blood, in letting blood the Artery.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:115892:102"/>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe, is mobility of the Artery, and therefore the wound or gaſh in it is ſlowly healed. Yet this letting of blood is wholeſome thrée mannet of ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when there is aboundauce of ſubtile blood in the body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the blood is vaporous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when it is hot. For ſubtile blood of which natural blood and ſpirits be engendred, reſt each in the artery: but groſs blood that nouriſheth the members, reſteth in the veins. Like wiſe the vaporous blood is contained in the artery, and ſanguine blood in the veyn. Alſo the hotteſt blood, the which is of the heart (the hotteſt member) engendred and digeſted, is contained in the Artery, and the other Blood in the Veyns.</p>
            <p>Secondly note, that the veyns are opened in many members, ſometime in the arm or in the hand great or ſmall, ſometime in the foot, ſometime in the noſe, ſometime in the fore-head, ſometime in the lips ſometime vnder the tongue, or in the roof of the mouth, ſometime in the corner of the Eyes toward the fore-head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the Arm-pit to the Elbow, are five veyns to be opened as Raſis and Avicen</hi> ſayth.</p>
            <p>The firſt is called <hi>Cephalica,</hi> which is the Head-veyn.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Baſilica,</hi> which is the Liver-veyn.</p>
            <p>The third is called <hi>Mediana,</hi> or <hi>Cardiaca,</hi> or <hi>Nigra,</hi> after <hi>Avicen,</hi> or <hi>Matrix,</hi> after <hi>Raſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is called <hi>Aſſillaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift is called <hi>Funis brachij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the left hand is <hi>Saluatella.</hi> ſo that in the arm, in that it contayneth the more and the leſſe hand, are ſix veyns to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, <hi>Cephalica</hi> emptieth the parts abont the neck, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to open that veyn, it is good for the diſeaſes of the head as the Megrim, and other hot griefs, cauſed of hot matter. This veyn beginneth at the ſhoulder, and goeth forth ſoward the left ſide of the arm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſilica</hi> emptieth the parts vnder the neck, as from the Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115892:103"/>is wholeſome for diſeaſes of the Breſt and Liver, and right good in a Pluriſle This veyn beginneth at the arm-hole, and goeth along to the bowing of the arm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mediana</hi> is betwéen theſe two ſaid veins, and is compact of them beth for it is the branch of each. And it is alſo <hi>Median</hi> in vacuation: for it voydeth from all about, vnder, from and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neck. Wherefore it is the vniverſall veyn to all the body in voyding: but not vniuerſall (as ſome ſay) becauſe it beginneth at the heart, but becauſe it is the branch of <hi>Cephali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and <hi>Baſilica.</hi> Therefore when you will let <hi>Cephalica</hi> bloud, and it appeareth not ye ſhould rather take <hi>Mediana,</hi> then <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</hi> And likewiſe when ye will let <hi>Baſilica</hi> bloud, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not ye ſhould rather miniſh <hi>Mediana,</hi> then <hi>Cephalica.</hi> For it agreeth better to both, then one of them with the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saluatella</hi> is the veyn between the middle finger and the ring-finger, more declining to the middle finger. It beginneth of <hi>Baſilica.</hi> This veyn is opened in the right hand, for opilation of the Liver, and in the left hand for opilation of the Splene.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no reaſon why it ſhould be ſo,</hi> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, but only Experience, which <hi>Galen</hi> ſound by a Dream (as he ſaith.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He had one in cure, whoſe Liver and Splene were ſtopt, and he dreamed that he did let him bloud of this veyn, and ſo he did, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Patient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this veyn is let bloud, the hand muſt be put in warm water to engroſſe and dilate it, becauſe it is ſuvtile; and that the gaſh ſhould not cloſe too ſoon, and to make the groſs bloud thin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſſillaris</hi> is vnder <hi>Baſilica,</hi> and appeareth in binding the arm: and the like judgment is of it as of <hi>Baſilica.</hi>

               <hi>That <hi>Cophalica</hi> is the ſurer, and <hi>Baſilica,</hi> more to be ſeared,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115892:103"/>and <hi>Cardiaca,</hi> is to be feard, but not ſo much as <hi>Baſilica.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Cephalica,</hi> is ſureſt, for there is neither ſinew nor Artery above nor under it, but vnder <hi>Cardiaca,</hi> there is a ſinew, and vyper above it is a ſubtil ſinew: therefore it is to fear, leaſt it ſhould be cut.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſilica</hi> is very jeopardous: for vnder it is an Artery, and near it a ſinew and a muſcle. <hi>Saluatella</hi> is not jeopardous, and therefore the better to open it, it would be put in warme water. In the feet he three veins, <hi>Scyatica, Saphena,</hi> and the Ham-veyn Theſe veynes be opened, to draw the bloud to the lawer paris as in provoking menſtruoſity, and the Hamme veyn is better then <hi>Saphena,</hi> or <hi>Scyatica;</hi> becauſe it is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the matrice. <hi>Saphena</hi> draweth blood from the yard, cordes and matrice, and <hi>Scyatica</hi> from the ancles, reynes, and other members towards mans left ſide. <hi>Saphena</hi> from the Matrice, and members there about, they be branches of one veyn. In the midſt of the forehead, is a veyn, which is opened for old diſeaſes of the face, as Morphew, dry ſcutſe, and Scab, and for diſeaſes of the eyes, but firſt <hi>Cephalica</hi> muſt be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe a veyn in the noſe, &amp; when any of them is opened the neck muſt be bound, &amp; one opened after another: and by binding of the neck they will better appear.</p>

            <p>Here the Author noting divers things ſaith:</p>
            <p>That much falling in Summer dryeth the body, for in that that Summer is of nature hot and dry, it reſolveth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: the which alſo be reſolved by oft ſweating in Summer, and ſo falling thereupon dryeth the body much more, for when the humidity of meates is gone, the heat of the body wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon his own humidities, and dryeth them clean away. Wherefore <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith: <hi>Hunger is expedient for thoſe that be very moyſt, for hunger dryeth the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is that vomiting once a moneth is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, for thereby hurtfull humors, that be contained in all the circuit of the ſtomack are voyded. To this agreeth <hi>Avicen,</hi> ſaying. <hi>Hypocrates biddeth one to vomit every month twice, two days one after another that the ſecond day may avoid it, that which the firſt could not; this conſerveth health and ſcoureth the ſtomack from flegm and choler. The ſtomack hath nothing to purge it like as the guts have red choler. Avicen</hi> putteth other preſts of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting that it is well done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is good for head-ach, cauſed of moyſt vapurous matters that aſcend from the ſtomack to the head, but if head-ach come of his own hurt of the brain, then vomiting doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt then proffe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it cleareth the ſight, darkned with vaporous matter of the ſtomack or elſe not.</p>
            <p>The third is, it doth away wambling of the ſtomack, in that it avoideth the hum is that cauſe it.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, it comforteth the ſtomack, into which choler is deſcended, the which corrupteth the meat.</p>
            <p>The fift is, it doth away loathing or abborting of meat.</p>
            <p>The ſixt is, it doth away the cauſe that maketh one have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſt to ſharp, pantike and ſower things, the which cauſe (by theſe diſpoſitions being removed) putteth or doth away the effects thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is, vomiting is wholeſome for the lask that commeth before the Dropſie, for it avoydeth the matter of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115892:105"/>ſaid lask and purgeth the ſtomack.</p>
            <p>The eight is, it is wholeſome for the grief of the reins and bladder, for it diverieth the matter that ſloweth of thoſe parts another way.</p>
            <p>The ninth is, if vomiting be done by conſtraint of <hi>Elchory,</hi> it avoydeth the matter whereof Lepry groweth: it amendeth the firſt digeſtion, that the other digeſtions may the better be done.</p>
            <p>The tenth is it maketh one to have a good colour.</p>
            <p>The eleventh is, it purgeth the ſtomack of a humor that cauſeth <hi>Epilepcy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twelfth is, by ſtrong conſtraint it removetth ſtopping matter, the which cauſeth <hi>Ictericy.</hi> And likewiſe it avoydeth a ſlegmatick matter, the which commonly is cauſe of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
            <p>The thirtéenth is, it avoydeth the matter that cauſeth <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> a diſeaſe that cauſeth one to draw his breath painfully, and alſo it comforteth the ſpirituall members, by whoſe heat the ſuperfluities that cauſe <hi>Aſma,</hi> are conſumed.</p>
            <p>The fourtéenth is, it is wholeſome againſt ſhaking and palſte, for it avoydeth the matter that is cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth is, it is wheleſome for one that hath great black ſores on his lower parts: for it turneth the humours from thence.</p>
            <p>Now although vomiting duly and well done, becauſe of theſe commodities, yet when it is vuduly done: <hi>It induceth many hurts, for it feebleth the ſtomack, and maketh it apt for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſlow into: it hurteth the breſt, the ſight, the teeth, cauſeth head-ach,</hi> as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>The third thing that is noted in the text is, that there bée foate Seaſons of the yeare, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Spring time in reſpect of the other Seaſons is vote and moyſt, though it be temperate in it ſelfe, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in his book of Complexions, wherefore it followeth, that this Seaſon is more apt to let bloud, then the other: for it doth more enereaſe humours. And therefore in this Seaſon, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115892:106"/>vſe of carnall copulation, temperate motion lask ſtire, and ſweat is convenient. and likewiſe temperate bathing to diminiſh repletion. This Seaſon is good to take purgations in.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, Summer heateth and dryeth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it encreaſeth red Choler hot and dry. And for this cauſe, is Summer we muſt ſeed on cold and moyſt meats, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ferventneſſe of the heat and drought. and then too ought to abſtain from carnall copulation, the which alſo, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and from oft hayning, and be let blaud ſeldome, nor like cauſe. We muſt vſe quietueſſe, and littie motion, for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth moyſt, and much motion dryeth.</p>
            <p>In this ſeaſon eſpecially we muſt vſe moderally to drink cold brink: for ſuperfluous drinking of cold drink (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the pores be open) doth make the body ſuddenly to take cold, or cauſeth the Palſle, or laraty of the members, or elſe ſudden death. From the which. He defend Vs, that liveth and raigneth eternally, <hi>A MEN.</hi>
